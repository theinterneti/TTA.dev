# Prompt for TTA.dev Cline Integration Phase 3 Session

## Session Context

You are continuing the TTA.dev Cline integration enhancement project. Phases 1 and 2 have been successfully completed:

- **Phase 1**: Quality Score 9.2/10 - 16 production-ready examples across 4 primitive types + 5 context templates
- **Phase 2**: Quality Score ~9.0/10 - 28+ examples across 7 primitive types + MCP server + workflow examples

The foundation is now solid with 90% primitive coverage and automatic recommendation capabilities.

## Objective for This Session

**Implement Phase 3 Advanced Features** to create the ultimate cline integration experience with intelligent, adaptive, and self-improving capabilities.

## Primary Tasks

### 1. Dynamic Context Loading System (60 minutes)

Build an intelligent system that automatically adapts cline context based on real-time development patterns:

**Smart Context Detection**

- Analyze current development context (file types, project structure, coding patterns)
- Automatically suggest relevant primitive examples based on context
- Context-aware template injection based on detected frameworks/libraries
- Language-specific optimization (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript patterns)

**Adaptive Learning**

- Learn from cline interactions to improve suggestions
- Track which examples are most useful for specific use cases
- Build personalized primitive recommendation profiles
- Continuous improvement of detection accuracy

### 2. Tool-Aware Suggestion Engine (45 minutes)

Create an advanced recommendation system that understands the full development context:

**Code Pattern Recognition**

- Analyze actual code patterns to suggest appropriate primitives
- Understand architectural patterns (microservices, data pipelines, AI workflows)
- Detect performance bottlenecks and suggest optimization primitives
- Identify error-prone patterns and recommend resilience primitives

**Multi-Modal Analysis**

- Parse code, comments, and documentation to understand intent
- Consider file relationships and dependencies
- Understand team patterns and coding standards
- Adapt to different project maturity levels

### 3. Enhanced Multi-Agent Optimization (45 minutes)

Build sophisticated coordination patterns for complex multi-agent workflows:

**Intelligent Agent Orchestration**

- Dynamic agent selection based on task complexity
- Load balancing across multiple agents
- Context-aware agent handoffs
- Performance optimization for agent chains

**Advanced Workflow Patterns**

- Conditional workflow execution based on context
- Dynamic primitive composition based on runtime conditions
- Self-healing workflows that adapt to failures
- Performance monitoring and automatic optimization

### 4. Advanced Analytics & Learning System (30 minutes)

Create a comprehensive feedback and improvement system:

**Usage Analytics**

- Track primitive usage patterns and success rates
- Measure developer satisfaction and productivity improvements
- Identify underutilized primitives and improve documentation
- Generate usage reports and recommendations

**Continuous Improvement**

- A/B testing framework for suggestion algorithms
- Feedback collection and processing system
- Automated improvement of detection patterns
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Quality Standards

- **Intelligent Automation** - Minimal manual intervention required
- **Real-time Adaptation** - Context changes trigger automatic updates
- **Self-Healing** - System adapts and improves from usage patterns
- **Developer-Centric** - Seamless experience with immediate value
- **Production-Ready** - Enterprise-grade reliability and performance
- **Measurable Impact** - Clear metrics for success and improvement

## Reference Implementation

- **Phase 1 Foundation**: `.cline/examples/primitives/` (16 examples)
- **Phase 2 Expansion**: MCP server + workflow examples (12 more examples)
- **Context Templates**: `.cline/context-templates/development_tasks.md`
- **Phase Summaries**: `CLINE_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`
- **Current State**: All Phase 1 and Phase 2 deliverables operational
