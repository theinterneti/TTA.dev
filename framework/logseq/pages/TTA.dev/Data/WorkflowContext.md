- ### Summary
  - `WorkflowContext` is a Pydantic model that provides distributed tracing, correlation tracking, and observability metadata for workflow execution.
- ### Fields
  - `workflow_id`: Unique identifier for the overall workflow.
  - `session_id`: Identifier for a user session.
  - `player_id`: Identifier for a specific player or agent.
  - `metadata`: General-purpose dictionary for arbitrary data.
  - `state`: Mutable dictionary for passing state between primitives.
  - `trace_id`, `span_id`, `parent_span_id`, `trace_flags`: W3C Trace Context fields for distributed tracing.
  - `correlation_id`: Unique ID for request correlation across services.
  - `causation_id`: ID of the event that caused this workflow.
  - `baggage`: W3C Baggage for cross-service context propagation.
  - `tags`: Custom tags for filtering and grouping observability data.
  - `start_time`: Timestamp when the workflow started.
  - `checkpoints`: List of named timing checkpoints.
