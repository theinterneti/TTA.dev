## Appendix: Decision Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mixed Quantitative Results

**Situation**: Strong token reduction (35%) but lower satisfaction (3.8)

**Analysis**:
- Investigate satisfaction drivers
- Check if training or documentation issues
- Evaluate if satisfaction improving over time
- Consider conditional GO with improvements

**Likely Decision**: CONDITIONAL GO with UX improvements

---

### Scenario 2: Strong Satisfaction, Weak Metrics

**Situation**: High satisfaction (4.5) but modest token reduction (18%)

**Analysis**:
- Verify measurement accuracy
- Check if benefits beyond token reduction
- Evaluate if target was too aggressive
- Consider if 18% is "good enough"

**Likely Decision**: GO with adjusted expectations

---

### Scenario 3: High Dropout Rate

**Situation**: Good metrics among completers but 50% dropout

**Analysis**:
- Interview dropouts to understand why
- Check for common pain points
- Evaluate if fixable issues
- Consider if sample bias in results

**Likely Decision**: NO-GO / Iterate to address retention

---

### Scenario 4: Polarized Feedback

**Situation**: Some love it (5/5), others hate it (2/5)

**Analysis**:
- Segment analysis: who loves/hates it?
- Identify use cases where it works/fails
- Evaluate if issues are fixable
- Consider targeted rollout

**Likely Decision**: CONDITIONAL GO to specific use cases
