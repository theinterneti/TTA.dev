# Gemini CLI Diagnostic Test Results

**Date**: October 30, 2025, 22:47 UTC  
**Workflow Run**: #18955932233  
**Duration**: 15 minutes 14 seconds (timeout)  
**Command**: `@gemini-cli help` (simple help command)  
**Expected Duration**: 1-2 minutes  
**Result**: ‚ùå **FAILED - Timeout after 15 minutes**

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**The diagnostic changes were NEVER applied to the workflow run.**

### Evidence

```json
{
  "headBranch": "main",
  "headSha": "1e4c75f40f7e5a1b85e9e0be8258cf598627ca38"
}
```

**The workflow ran from the `main` branch, NOT from the `test/gemini-cli-diagnostics` branch.**

---

## Root Cause of Test Failure

### Why Diagnostic Configuration Was Not Used

**Line 130 of `gemini-dispatch.yml`**:
```yaml
uses: './.github/workflows/gemini-invoke.yml'
```

**Explanation**:
- This uses the workflow file from the **current branch** (main)
- When a PR is created, workflows are triggered on the **base branch** (main), not the PR branch
- The `gemini-dispatch.yml` workflow runs on `main`, so it uses `main`'s version of `gemini-invoke.yml`
- Therefore, the diagnostic configuration in the test branch was never executed

### What Actually Ran (Main Branch - Commit `1e4c75f`)

1. ‚ùå **NO Docker pre-pull step** - Not in main branch
2. ‚ùå **Telemetry ENABLED** - `"enabled": ${{ vars.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT != '' }}`
3. ‚úÖ **Debug logging enabled** - This was in main from PR #62
4. ‚úÖ **15-minute timeout** - This worked correctly

### What Was Expected (Test Branch - Commit `0c45d04`)

1. ‚úÖ Docker pre-pull step - To measure image pull time
2. ‚úÖ Telemetry disabled - To rule out GCP telemetry overhead
3. ‚úÖ Debug logging enabled - For detailed traces

## Workflow Execution Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event | Elapsed |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 21:45:36 | Workflow started | 0s |
| 21:45:47 | "Run Gemini CLI" step started | 11s |
| 22:00:50 | **Timeout triggered** | 15m 14s |
| 22:01:01 | Workflow cancelled | 15m 25s |

**Total Duration**: 15 minutes 14 seconds

---

## Key Findings

### 1. ‚úÖ Timeout Configuration Works

**Evidence**: Workflow timed out at exactly 15 minutes (15m 14s including cleanup)

**Conclusion**: The timeout configuration from PR #62 successfully prevented the indefinite hang (90+ minutes in run #18953391176)

**Impact**: This is a **critical safety improvement** - prevents runaway workflows from consuming excessive resources

---

### 2. ‚ùå Diagnostic Test Invalid

**Evidence**: Workflow ran from `main` branch, not `test/gemini-cli-diagnostics` branch

**Conclusion**: The diagnostic test did not actually test the diagnostic configuration

**Impact**: We still don't know if Docker pull overhead or telemetry is the bottleneck

---

### 3. ‚ùå Still Hitting Timeout

**Evidence**: Workflow cannot complete within 15 minutes even with timeout

**Conclusion**: The underlying performance issue is NOT resolved

**Impact**: The workflow is still unusable for production (15 minutes for a simple `help` command is unacceptable)

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fundamental Limitation

**Evidence**: GitHub Actions workflows use the base branch's workflow files, not the PR branch's

**Conclusion**: Cannot test PR branch workflows without merging or manual triggering

**Impact**: Need alternative testing strategy

## Annotations from Workflow Run

### 1. Timeout Error

```
‚ùå The job has exceeded the maximum execution time of 15m0s
invoke / invoke: .github#1
```

**Analysis**: Timeout is working correctly

---

### 2. Operation Cancelled

```
‚ùå The operation was canceled.
invoke / invoke: .github#1465
```

**Analysis**: Workflow was cancelled after timeout

---

### 3. Debug Logging Warning

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Gemini CLI debug logging is enabled. This will stream responses, which could reveal sensitive information if processed with untrusted inputs.
invoke / invoke: .github#1368
```

**Analysis**: Debug logging is enabled (from main branch)

---

### 4. API Key Configuration Warning

```
‚ö†Ô∏è When using 'gemini_api_key', both 'use_vertex_ai' and 'use_gemini_code_assist' must be 'false'.
invoke / invoke: .github#554
```

**Analysis**: Configuration issue - `use_gemini_code_assist: true` conflicts with `gemini_api_key`

**Potential Impact**: This could be causing the hang! Gemini Code Assist may require different authentication or have different performance characteristics.

---

## New Hypothesis: Gemini Code Assist Configuration Issue

### Evidence

**From workflow logs**:
```yaml
gemini_api_key: ***
use_gemini_code_assist: true
use_vertex_ai: false
```

**Warning message**:
> When using 'gemini_api_key', both 'use_vertex_ai' and 'use_gemini_code_assist' must be 'false'.

### Analysis

**Possible Scenarios**:

1. **Authentication Conflict**: Gemini Code Assist may be trying to authenticate with Vertex AI while using API key
2. **Retry Loop**: The action may be retrying authentication indefinitely
3. **Timeout Waiting for Auth**: The action may be waiting for authentication to succeed

### Recommendation

**Test with corrected configuration**:
```yaml
gemini_api_key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
use_gemini_code_assist: false  # CHANGE THIS
use_vertex_ai: false
```

## Comparison with Karl Stoney's Production

### Karl Stoney's Configuration

- **Execution Time**: 3-5 minutes for complex PR reviews
- **Environment**: Kubernetes with pre-configured MCP servers
- **Authentication**: Likely using Vertex AI or GCP service accounts
- **MCP Servers**: Pre-deployed, not Docker-based

### TTA.dev Configuration

- **Execution Time**: 15+ minutes (timeout) for simple `help` command
- **Environment**: GitHub Actions with Docker-based MCP servers
- **Authentication**: API key with conflicting `use_gemini_code_assist: true`
- **MCP Servers**: Docker-based, pulled on every run

### Key Differences

1. **Authentication Method**: Karl Stoney likely uses Vertex AI, we use API key with conflicting settings
2. **MCP Server Deployment**: Karl Stoney uses pre-deployed servers, we use Docker pull on every run
3. **Execution Environment**: Kubernetes vs GitHub Actions

---

## Root Cause Hypotheses (Updated)

### 1. üî¥ **Authentication Configuration Issue** (NEW - HIGH PROBABILITY)

**Evidence**:
- Warning: "When using 'gemini_api_key', both 'use_vertex_ai' and 'use_gemini_code_assist' must be 'false'"
- Current config: `use_gemini_code_assist: true` with `gemini_api_key`

**Test**: Set `use_gemini_code_assist: false`

**Expected**: Significant time reduction if this is the cause

---

### 2. üî¥ **Docker Image Pull Overhead** (HIGH PROBABILITY)

**Evidence**:
- Docker-based MCP server configured
- No pre-pull step in workflow
- Karl Stoney uses pre-deployed servers

**Test**: Add Docker pre-pull step (requires merging to main or manual trigger)

**Expected**: 1-5 minutes for image pull on slow networks

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Telemetry Configuration Issues** (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)

**Evidence**:
- Telemetry enabled and set to send data to GCP
- No verification that GCP project is correctly configured

**Test**: Disable telemetry (requires merging to main or manual trigger)

**Expected**: Significant time reduction if this is the cause

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚úÖ **Fix Authentication Configuration** (can be done in main branch)
   - Set `use_gemini_code_assist: false` in `gemini-invoke.yml`
   - Test with simple `@gemini-cli help` command
   - Expected: Workflow completes within 1-2 minutes

2. ‚è≥ **If authentication fix doesn't work, test Docker pre-pull**
   - Merge test branch to main OR manually trigger workflow
   - Measure Docker pull time
   - Expected: Identify if Docker pull is the bottleneck

3. ‚è≥ **If Docker pull is not the bottleneck, disable telemetry**
   - Set `"telemetry": {"enabled": false}` in main branch
   - Test again
   - Expected: Identify if telemetry is the bottleneck

### Alternative Testing Strategy

**Option 1: Merge Diagnostic Configuration to Main**
- Pros: Can test immediately
- Cons: Adds diagnostic code to production

**Option 2: Manual Workflow Trigger**
- Pros: Can test without merging
- Cons: Requires workflow_dispatch trigger configuration

**Option 3: Create Separate Diagnostic Workflow**
- Pros: Clean separation of diagnostic and production code
- Cons: More complex setup

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **GitHub Actions Limitation**: Workflows use base branch files, not PR branch files
2. **Configuration Validation**: Always check for warnings in workflow logs
3. **Authentication Conflicts**: API key and Gemini Code Assist are incompatible
4. **Timeout is Essential**: 15-minute timeout prevented 90+ minute hang
5. **Testing Strategy**: Need alternative approach for testing workflow changes
