# Gemini CLI Capabilities Analysis

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: Analysis Complete - Write Operations ARE Supported  
**Critical Finding**: Initial limitation assessment was INCORRECT

---

## Executive Summary

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**: The GitHub MCP server v0.20.1 **DOES support write operations** including file creation, commits, and PR creation. The "limitations" documented were based on incomplete analysis of the MCP server capabilities.

### Corrected Capability Assessment

| Capability | Previously Assessed | **ACTUAL Status** | Evidence |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| File Creation | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ **SUPPORTED** | `create_or_update_file` tool (line 119) |
| Direct Commits | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ **SUPPORTED** | `push_files` tool (line 125) |
| PR Creation | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ **SUPPORTED** | `create_pull_request` tool (line 114) |
| Branch Creation | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ **SUPPORTED** | `create_branch` tool (line 118) |
| File Deletion | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ **SUPPORTED** | `delete_file` tool (line 120) |

## 2. Limitation Assessment (CORRECTED)

### Technical Constraints vs Design Decisions

| "Limitation" | Assessment | Reality |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| No file creation | ‚ùå **INCORRECT** | ‚úÖ `create_or_update_file` tool available |
| No direct commits | ‚ùå **INCORRECT** | ‚úÖ `push_files` tool available |
| No PR merging | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY CORRECT** | ‚ùå No `merge_pull_request` tool in current config |
| Read-only by default | ‚ùå **INCORRECT** | ‚úÖ Write tools are enabled |

### Actual Limitations

| Limitation | Type | Reason | Workaround |
|------------|------|--------|------------|
| **No PR Merging** | Configuration | `merge_pull_request` not in `includeTools` | Can be added to workflow config |
| **No Repository Settings** | Technical | MCP server doesn't expose settings API | Use GitHub UI or API directly |
| **No GitHub Actions Modification** | Security | Intentional - prevents workflow tampering | Correct design decision |
| **No Secrets Access** | Security | Intentional - prevents credential exposure | Correct design decision |

### Security Considerations

**Why Some Operations Are Restricted**:
1. **No Workflow Modification**: Prevents malicious code injection into CI/CD
2. **No Secrets Access**: Prevents credential theft
3. **No Force Push**: Prevents history rewriting
4. **No Repository Deletion**: Prevents accidental data loss

**These are INTENTIONAL and CORRECT design decisions.**
