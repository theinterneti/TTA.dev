# Gemini CLI Write Capabilities Test

**Purpose**: This file exists to test Gemini CLI's write capabilities after PR #73 enabled `contents: write` permissions.

## Test Scenario

This PR will trigger the Gemini dispatch workflow on `pull_request.opened` event, which should:

1. ✅ Trigger the workflow automatically (no `@gemini-cli` mention needed)
2. ✅ Run with `contents: write` permissions
3. ✅ Allow Gemini CLI to create files, branches, and PRs

## Expected Workflow Behavior

When this PR is opened, the `gemini-dispatch.yml` workflow should:

- Trigger on `pull_request.opened` event (line 10-12)
- Meet the dispatch condition (line 51-52): `github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == false`
- Execute the `invoke` job with write permissions
- Run Gemini CLI with the PR title and description as context

## Test Command

Once the PR is open and the workflow triggers, we can post this command to test write operations:

```markdown
@gemini-cli Create a test file at docs/test-gemini-write-success.md with the content 
"This file was created by Gemini CLI on October 31, 2025 to verify write capabilities. 
The GitHub MCP server v0.20.1 supports file creation, commits, and PR creation." 
Create a PR titled "test: verify Gemini CLI write capabilities - automated test".
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Workflow triggers on PR open
- ✅ Workflow runs without startup failure
- ✅ Gemini CLI can create files
- ✅ Gemini CLI can create branches
- ✅ Gemini CLI can create PRs
- ✅ Execution time: 1-2 minutes (not 15+ minutes)
