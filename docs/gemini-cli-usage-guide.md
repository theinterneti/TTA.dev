# Gemini CLI Usage Guide

**Quality-first AI code review and development assistance**

---

## üéØ Quick Start

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Invoke Gemini with default quality model (thinking)
@gemini-cli Review this PR for best practices

# Get help
@gemini-cli /help

# Review code
@gemini-cli /review

# Triage an issue
@gemini-cli /triage
```

### Model Tiers

The system uses **gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219** by default for highest quality reasoning.

**Available Tiers:**
- **thinking** (default) - Extended reasoning, shows thought process, highest quality
- **pro** - Proven quality, balanced performance  
- **fast** - Quick responses for simple tasks
- **auto** - Automatically selects based on task complexity

---

## üí° Example Use Cases

### Code Review (Default - Quality Mode)

```bash
@gemini-cli /review
```

This uses the thinking model for deep analysis showing reasoning steps.

### Complex Architectural Decision

```bash
@gemini-cli Should we refactor this module to use dependency injection? 
Consider our existing patterns and the long-term maintainability.
```

Auto-detected as complex ‚Üí uses thinking model.

### Documentation Lookup with Context7

```bash
@gemini-cli Using Context7, verify this FastAPI implementation follows best practices
```

Gemini will:
1. Use Context7 MCP to lookup FastAPI documentation
2. Compare your code against official patterns
3. Provide specific recommendations with references

### Quick Question (Fast Mode)

For simple queries where you want speed over extended reasoning, you can request fast mode (coming soon in dispatch enhancements).

## üîß Available Tools

Gemini has access to the following capabilities:

### GitHub Operations (18 tools)

- File management: create_or_update_file, delete_file, get_file_contents
- Branch operations: create_branch
- Pull requests: create_pull_request, list_pull_requests, search_pull_requests
- Issues: add_issue_comment, get_issue, list_issues, search_issues

**Example prompts that leverage Context7:**
```bash
@gemini-cli Check if this uses the latest Pydantic v2 patterns

@gemini-cli Review SQLAlchemy usage against current best practices

@gemini-cli Is this FastAPI route handler correctly structured per docs?
```

---

## üß† Quality Mode (Thinking Model)

The default thinking model provides:

### Extended Reasoning
Shows its thought process before providing answers:
- Analyzes the problem
- Considers alternatives
- Evaluates tradeoffs
- Reaches a conclusion

### Better for Complex Tasks
- Architectural decisions
- Security analysis
- Performance optimization
- Refactoring plans
- Complex debugging

### Higher Accuracy
- Fewer hallucinations
- More thorough analysis
- Better context understanding
- Stronger reasoning chains

---

## üìä Model Selection Logic

When you use `@gemini-cli` without specifying a model, the system auto-selects based on keywords:

### Thinking Model (Quality)
Triggered by keywords:
- architect, design, complex, refactor
- "analyze deeply"
- Security reviews
- Performance analysis

### Pro Model (Balanced)  
Triggered by keywords:
- review, analyze, explain, document
- Standard code reviews
- Documentation generation

### Fast Model (Speed)
Triggered by:
- Simple questions
- Quick triage
- Basic queries

Default: **thinking** (quality over speed)

## üé® Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Tool Usage

Gemini can chain multiple tools:

```bash
@gemini-cli 
1. Search our codebase for similar authentication patterns
2. Look up the latest OAuth2 best practices using Context7  
3. Review this PR's auth implementation
4. Create a security checklist as an issue
```

Gemini will:
1. Use `search_code` for internal patterns
2. Use Context7 for OAuth2 docs
3. Review the PR code
4. Use `add_issue_comment` to document findings

### Documentation-Driven Review

```bash
@gemini-cli Review this API implementation:
1. Check against FastAPI docs (use Context7)
2. Verify our internal API guidelines (search codebase)  
3. Suggest improvements with references
```

### Incremental Improvements

```bash
@gemini-cli Create a branch with formatting fixes for this file
```

Gemini will:
1. Analyze the file
2. Create a new branch
3. Make targeted improvements
4. Push changes
5. Create a PR with detailed explanation

## üéì Tips & Best Practices

### Be Specific

```bash
# ‚ùå Vague
@gemini-cli check this

# ‚úÖ Specific
@gemini-cli Review the authentication logic in auth.py for security vulnerabilities, 
focusing on token validation and session management
```

### Leverage Context7

```bash
# ‚ùå Generic
@gemini-cli Is this FastAPI code correct?

# ‚úÖ Leverages docs
@gemini-cli Using Context7, verify this FastAPI code follows the official 
dependency injection patterns and best practices
```

### Ask for Reasoning

```bash
# ‚úÖ Shows thought process
@gemini-cli Explain your reasoning: Should we use Redis or Memcached for caching?
```

### Request Incremental Work

```bash
# ‚úÖ Clear scope
@gemini-cli Create a PR that adds input validation to the user registration endpoint
```

### Use Multi-Step Instructions

```bash
# ‚úÖ Structured approach
@gemini-cli 
1. Analyze the performance bottleneck in this code
2. Research best practices for optimization using Context7
3. Propose 3 specific improvements with tradeoffs
4. If I approve, create a PR with the best option
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Gemini Doesn't Respond

**Check:**
1. Did you tag `@gemini-cli` at the start?
2. Are you an OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR?
3. Is this a forked repository? (Not currently supported)

**View logs:**
The acknowledgment comment includes a link to workflow logs.

### Context7 Not Finding Documentation

**Try:**
1. Be specific with library names: "FastAPI" not "fast api"
2. Specify version if needed: "Pydantic v2"
3. Use official package names: "SQLAlchemy" not "sqlalchemy"

### Quality Issues

**Improve by:**
1. Providing more context in your request
2. Being specific about what you want analyzed
3. Asking for reasoning: "Explain your thought process"
4. Using the thinking model for complex tasks (default)
