# Phase 4 Next Steps - Quick Reference

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025

---

## ðŸš€ Immediate Next Actions

### 1. Create Interactive Whiteboards (Priority: HIGH)

**What to do:**
1. Open Logseq desktop application
2. Load the TTA.dev graph (`/home/thein/repos/TTA.dev/logseq/`)
3. Navigate to these pages:
   - [[Whiteboard - TTA.dev Architecture Overview]]
   - [[Whiteboard - Workflow Composition Patterns]]
   - [[Whiteboard - Recovery Patterns Flow]]
4. For each page:
   - Click "..." menu (top right)
   - Select "Open in whiteboard"
   - Create visual diagram following the template
   - Use shapes: rectangles, circles, arrows
   - Apply color coding (blue=core, green=recovery, yellow=decisions)
5. Export each whiteboard:
   - Right-click whiteboard
   - "Export as PNG"
   - Save to `docs/architecture/diagrams/`

**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Blocker:** Need Logseq UI access

### 2. Write Remaining How-To Guides (Priority: HIGH)

#### Guide 3: How to Compose Complex Workflows

**File:** `docs/guides/how-to-compose-workflows.md`

**Content to include:**
- Starting with simple patterns
- Building complex compositions
- Sequential + Parallel mixing
- Router-based workflows
- Recovery pattern stacking
- Real-world examples (RAG, multi-agent)
- Performance considerations
- Testing composed workflows
- Common mistakes

**Template:** Use `how-to-create-primitive.md` structure

**Time:** 2-3 hours

#### Guide 4: How to Test Primitives

**File:** `docs/guides/how-to-test-primitives.md`

**Content to include:**
- Testing philosophy
- Unit test structure
- Using MockPrimitive
- Testing composition
- Testing error handling
- Testing async behavior
- Integration tests
- Coverage requirements
- CI/CD integration
- Examples for each primitive type

**Template:** Use `how-to-add-observability.md` structure

**Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### 3. Migrate ADRs to Logseq (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Files to migrate:**

1. `DECISION_RECORDS.md` â†’ `TTA.dev/Architecture/ADR/Decision Records Index`
2. `MONOREPO_STRUCTURE.md` â†’ `TTA.dev/Architecture/ADR/Monorepo Structure`
3. `OBSERVABILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md` â†’ `TTA.dev/Architecture/ADR/Observability Architecture`
4. `PRIMITIVE_PATTERNS.md` â†’ `TTA.dev/Architecture/ADR/Primitive Patterns`
5. `COMPONENT_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` â†’ `TTA.dev/Architecture/ADR/Component Integration`

**Process for each file:**

```bash
# 1. Create Logseq page
# In logseq/pages/TTA.dev/Architecture/ADR/
touch "Monorepo Structure.md"

# 2. Convert content
# - Add Logseq metadata (date, status, related pages)
# - Convert headers to Logseq format
# - Add [[internal links]]
# - Add properties (type::, priority::, etc.)

# 3. Link from index
# Add to TTA.dev/Architecture/ADR index page

# 4. Link from whiteboard
# Reference from Architecture Overview whiteboard
```

**Time:** 6-8 hours (1-1.5 hours per file)

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### For Whiteboards
- Start simple, add detail iteratively
- Use consistent shapes/colors
- Don't overcrowd - multiple boards better than one complex one
- Link shapes to pages - it's interactive!
- Export frequently (backups)

### For How-To Guides
- Write for your past self
- Assume minimal knowledge
- Include "why" not just "how"
- Real examples > theoretical explanations
- Common mistakes section = gold

### For ADR Migration
- Keep original files as reference
- Don't lose information in translation
- Add more links than you think needed
- Properties enable powerful queries later
- Test links after creation

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

### Whiteboard Issues
- **Can't open whiteboard:** Ensure Logseq desktop app installed
- **Lost work:** Check `.logseq/` directory for autosaves
- **Export failed:** Try "Export visible area" instead of full board

### Writing Issues
- **Stuck on guide:** Review existing guides for structure
- **Code examples:** Test in `examples/` first, then document
- **Links broken:** Use relative paths, check file exists

### Migration Issues
- **Format confusion:** Keep original side-by-side for reference
- **Link syntax:** Use `[[Page Name]]` for Logseq links
- **Properties:** Format is `property:: value` on its own line

**Remember:** Progress over perfection. Ship iteratively!
