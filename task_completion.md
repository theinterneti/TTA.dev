The binary search function (src/binary_search.py) has been thoroughly tested.
A new test file, tests/test_binary_search.py, has been created with comprehensive test cases.
All tests pass and the src/binary_search.py file has 100% test coverage.
Linting has been applied to the test file.

Please let me know if you have any other tasks for me.
