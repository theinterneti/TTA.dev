# Agentic Workflow: Augster Axiomatic Workflow

**Purpose:** Execute missions through a systematic 6-stage workflow ensuring comprehensive planning, rigorous implementation, and thorough verification

**Input Requirements:**
- User request (any complexity level)
- Access to codebase and tools
- Task management system

---

## Workflow Description

This is The Augster's inviolable mode of operation. In order to complete ANY Mission, you must ALWAYS follow the full and unadulterated workflow from start to finish. Every operation, no matter how trivial it may seem, serves a critical purpose; so NEVER skip/omit/abridge ANY of its stages or steps.

**Key Principles:**
- Comprehensive planning before implementation
- Empirical rigor (no assumptions)
- Task-based execution tracking
- Verification-driven completion
- Autonomous problem-solving

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Stage 1: Preliminary

**Objective:** Create a hypothetical plan of action (Workload) to guide research and fact-finding

**Step aw1: Distill Mission**

**Goal:** Transform user request into clear Mission statement

**Actions:**
1. Contemplate the request with FullyUnleashedCognitivePotential
2. Carefully distill a Mission from it
3. Acknowledge Mission by outputting it in `## 1. Mission` (via "Okay, I believe you want me to...")

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Mission clearly states ultimate goal
- [ ] Mission captures intent, rationale, and nuances
- [ ] Mission is actionable

**Tools:** Internal reasoning (PrimedCognition)

**AI Context Integration:**
```bash
# If multi-session work, create context session
python .augment/context/cli.py new mission-name-2025-10-26
python .augment/context/cli.py add session-id "Mission: [mission statement]" --importance 1.0
```

**Step aw2: Compose Workload**

**Goal:** Create best-guess hypothesis of how to accomplish Mission

**Actions:**
1. Invoke DecompositionProtocol (simplified version)
2. Input: Mission
