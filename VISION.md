# TTA.dev Vision: Democratizing AI-Native Software Development

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Author:** TTA.dev Core Team
**Status:** Living Document

---

## üéØ The North Star

**Empower ANYONE to build AI-native applications**, regardless of technical expertise, by providing a composable framework that guides users through the entire software development lifecycle using AI agents and workflow primitives.

---

## üåü The Problem We're Solving

### Current Reality

**Non-technical founders** and **early-stage builders** face insurmountable barriers:

1. **No Framework for Development Stages**
   - Experimentation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Production
   - Users don't know which stage they're in or what's required to advance
   - No validation of readiness to proceed

2. **Missing Role-Based Guidance**
   - Need DevOps expert but don't know what they do
   - Need QA expert but don't understand testing strategies
   - Need Git expert but confused about branching/merging
   - Need GitHub expert but lost in releases/deployments

3. **Lack of Specialized Tools**
   - Generic "just write code" doesn't help non-technical users
   - Need atomic workflows that compose into solutions
   - Need guardrails to prevent mistakes
   - Need best practices baked in

4. **Frustrating Learning Curve**
   - "I have amazing ideas but don't know how to implement them"
   - "I don't know what I don't know"
   - "Help me avoid mistakes and find easier solutions"

### What We're Building

A **meta-framework** that:
- Understands the software development lifecycle
- Provides role-based AI agents as guides
- Offers composable, atomic workflow primitives
- Validates readiness at each stage
- Prevents common mistakes
- Suggests best practices contextually
- Makes the invisible visible

---

## üèóÔ∏è The Architecture

### 1. Development Lifecycle Primitives

**Core Concept:** Software development is a workflow that can be represented as composable primitives.

```python
# Define the lifecycle
from tta_dev_primitives.lifecycle import DevelopmentLifecycle, Stage

lifecycle = DevelopmentLifecycle(
    stages=[
        Stage.EXPERIMENTATION,  # Idea validation, prototyping
        Stage.TESTING,          # Automated testing
        Stage.STAGING,          # Pre-production validation
        Stage.DEPLOYMENT,       # Production deployment
        Stage.PRODUCTION,       # Live monitoring
    ]
)

# Check readiness to advance
readiness = await lifecycle.check_readiness(
    current=Stage.EXPERIMENTATION,
    target=Stage.DEPLOYMENT
)

if not readiness.ready:
    print("Blockers:")
    for blocker in readiness.blockers:
        print(f"  - {blocker.message}")
        if blocker.fix_command:
            print(f"    Fix: {blocker.fix_command}")
```

**Entry Criteria:** What must be true to enter a stage
**Exit Criteria:** What must be true to advance
**Validation Rules:** Automated checks for readiness
**Recovery Patterns:** What to do when checks fail

### 2. Role-Based Agent System

**Core Concept:** Different roles provide different expertise at different stages.

```python
from tta_dev_primitives.agents import (
    DeveloperAgent,
    QAAgent,
    DevOpsAgent,
    GitAgent,
    GitHubAgent,
    SecurityAgent,
    PerformanceAgent,
)

# Experimentation stage: Need developer + git expert
experimentation_team = DeveloperAgent() | GitAgent()

# Testing stage: Add QA expert
testing_team = experimentation_team | QAAgent()

# Deployment stage: Add DevOps + GitHub + Security experts
deployment_team = testing_team | DevOpsAgent() | GitHubAgent() | SecurityAgent()

# Production stage: Add performance monitoring expert
production_team = deployment_team | PerformanceAgent()

# Ask the team for guidance
guidance = await deployment_team.assess_readiness(
    project_path="./packages/tta-workflow-primitives-mcp"
)
```

**Each Agent Knows:**
- Their domain expertise
- Common mistakes in their domain
- Best practices
- Tools they use
- Validation checks they perform
- How to explain concepts simply

### 3. Guided Workflow System

**Core Concept:** Interactive, step-by-step guidance through complex tasks.

```python
from tta_dev_primitives.guided import GuidedWorkflow, Step

# Define a guided workflow for MCP server deployment
mcp_deployment = GuidedWorkflow(
    name="Deploy MCP Server to GitHub Registry",
    description="Step-by-step guide for publishing your first MCP server",
    estimated_time="2-3 hours",
    difficulty="Intermediate",
    steps=[
        Step(
            name="Validate Package Structure",
            description="Ensure your package has all required files",
            agent=DeveloperAgent(),
            validation=lambda: check_package_structure(),
            on_failure="Create missing files using templates",
        ),
        Step(
            name="Run Tests",
            description="Verify all tests pass",
            agent=QAAgent(),
            validation=lambda: run_tests(),
            on_failure="Fix failing tests or ask QA agent for help",
        ),
        Step(
            name="Create MCP Manifest",
            description="Define metadata for GitHub MCP Registry",
            agent=GitHubAgent(),
            validation=lambda: validate_mcp_manifest(),
            on_failure="Use manifest template and fill in details",
        ),
        # ... more steps
    ],
)

# Execute the guided workflow
result = await mcp_deployment.execute(interactive=True)
```

**Features:**
- Shows current step and progress
- Explains why each step matters
- Validates before proceeding
- Suggests fixes when validation fails
- Estimates time remaining
- Allows skipping optional steps
- Saves progress for resumption

### 4. Knowledge Integration System

**Core Concept:** Capture and surface best practices contextually.

```python
from tta_dev_primitives.knowledge import KnowledgeBase, Topic

kb = KnowledgeBase()

# Add knowledge
kb.add(
    topic=Topic.DEPLOYMENT,
    concept="MCP Manifest",
    description="Metadata file required for GitHub MCP Registry",
    best_practices=[
        "Use semantic versioning (e.g., 0.1.0)",
        "Include all tool descriptions",
        "Add keywords for discoverability",
        "Specify license (MIT or Apache 2.0 recommended)",
    ],
    common_mistakes=[
        "Forgetting to update version on each release",
        "Vague tool descriptions that confuse users",
        "Missing repository URL",
    ],
    examples=[
        "See packages/tta-workflow-primitives-mcp/mcp-manifest.json",
    ],
)

# Query knowledge contextually
advice = kb.query(
    topic=Topic.DEPLOYMENT,
    context={"task": "creating mcp manifest", "experience_level": "beginner"},
)
```

**Knowledge Sources:**
- Built-in best practices (curated by experts)
- Community contributions (verified)
- Project-specific patterns (learned from codebase)
- User feedback (what worked/didn't work)

### 5. Validation & Safety Primitives

**Core Concept:** Prevent mistakes before they happen.

```python
from tta_dev_primitives.validation import (
    ValidationPrimitive,
    PreventMistakePrimitive,
    SafetyCheckPrimitive,
)

# Prevent common deployment mistakes
deployment_safety = PreventMistakePrimitive(
    checks=[
        ("secrets_in_code", "Ensure no API keys in source code"),
        ("tests_pass", "All tests must pass"),
        ("version_bumped", "Version number incremented"),
        ("changelog_updated", "CHANGELOG.md updated"),
        ("git_clean", "No uncommitted changes"),
    ]
)

# Run before deployment
result = await deployment_safety.execute(context, project_path)
if not result.safe:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è  Found issues:")
    for issue in result.issues:
        print(f"  - {issue.message}")
        print(f"    Fix: {issue.suggested_fix}")
```

## üé¨ User Experience: Before & After

### Before TTA.dev (Current Reality)

**User:** "I want to deploy my MCP server to GitHub's registry."

**Reality:**
1. User Googles "how to deploy MCP server"
2. Finds scattered documentation
3. Doesn't know if they're ready to deploy
4. Doesn't know what tests to write
5. Doesn't know what "production ready" means
6. Makes mistakes (missing manifest, no tests, secrets in code)
7. Submission rejected or broken in production
8. **Gives up** üòû

### After TTA.dev (Vision)

**User:** "I want to deploy my MCP server to GitHub's registry."

**TTA.dev:**

```
ü§ñ TTA.dev Assistant

I'll help you deploy to GitHub MCP Registry! Let me first assess your readiness.

üîç Running deployment readiness check...

üìä RESULTS
Current Stage: EXPERIMENTATION
Target Stage: DEPLOYMENT
Ready: ‚ùå NO

üö´ BLOCKERS (must fix):
1. Package structure incomplete
   - Missing: tests/ directory
   - Fix: mkdir tests && create test files
   - Why: GitHub requires tested code

2. No MCP manifest
   - Missing: mcp-manifest.json
   - Fix: Use template (I'll generate it for you)
   - Why: Registry needs metadata about your server

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL (should fix):
1. No examples/
   - Fix: Create 2-3 working examples
   - Why: Users need to see how to use your server

üí° RECOMMENDATION:
You're in the EXPERIMENTATION stage. Before deploying, let's:
1. Complete package structure (15 min)
2. Write basic tests (30 min)
3. Create MCP manifest (10 min)
4. Add examples (20 min)

Total estimated time: 75 minutes

Would you like me to:
[A] Guide me through each step interactively
[B] Auto-fix what you can and let me review
[C] Show me a detailed checklist
[D] Explain deployment process first

Your choice: _
```

**User picks [A]**

```
‚ú® Great! Let's start with package structure.

üì¶ STEP 1 of 4: Create Package Structure

Current structure:
  src/
    tta_workflow_primitives_mcp/
      server.py

Missing:
  - tests/ directory
  - examples/ directory
  - mcp-manifest.json
  - LICENSE file

I can create these for you. Here's what I'll do:

1. Create tests/ with template test file
2. Create examples/ with basic usage example
3. Generate mcp-manifest.json from your server.py
4. Add MIT license (most common for MCP servers)

Proceed? [Y/n]: _
```

**User:** Y

```
‚úÖ Created tests/test_server.py (template with TODOs)
‚úÖ Created examples/basic_usage.py
‚úÖ Generated mcp-manifest.json
‚úÖ Added LICENSE (MIT)

üìä Progress: 1/4 steps complete (25%)

üß™ STEP 2 of 4: Write Tests

I see you have 3 tools in server.py:
- create_sequential_workflow
- create_parallel_workflow
- execute_workflow

Let me generate test templates for each...

‚úÖ Generated test_create_sequential_workflow()
‚úÖ Generated test_create_parallel_workflow()
‚úÖ Generated test_execute_workflow()

Now let's run them to see if they pass:

$ uv run pytest tests/ -v
...
FAILED tests/test_server.py::test_create_sequential_workflow

‚ùå 1 test failed. Let me help you fix it.

The issue: AssertionError: expected 'workflow_id' in result

This means your create_sequential_workflow() tool isn't returning
a workflow_id. This is required for users to reference the workflow.

Would you like me to:
[A] Fix this automatically
[B] Show me the code change needed
[C] Explain why workflow_id is important

Your choice: _
```

**This is the vision!** TTA.dev becomes the **experienced developer sitting next to you**, guiding you through every decision, preventing mistakes, and teaching as you go.
