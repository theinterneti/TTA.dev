## About This Archive

This directory contains **deprecated status documents** from Phase 3 example development. These files were intermediate progress reports that have been superseded by the comprehensive guide.

**Current Documentation:** [`PHASE3_EXAMPLES_COMPLETE.md`](../../PHASE3_EXAMPLES_COMPLETE.md)

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during the iterative development of Phase 3 examples. They contain:
- Multiple completion reports as examples were fixed
- Incremental progress updates
- Some outdated API references
- Duplicate information

The comprehensive guide consolidates all this information into a single, accurate, up-to-date reference.
