# Database

This directory contains database integration components for the TTA.dev framework. These are reusable components for working with various database systems.

## Overview

The database directory includes:

- Database abstractions and interfaces
- Integration with various database systems (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Query builders and ORM-like functionality
- Migration and schema management tools
- Connection pooling and optimization utilities

## Usage

Database components can be imported and used in your applications:

```python
from tta.dev.database import Neo4jClient

client = Neo4jClient(uri="bolt://localhost:7687", username="neo4j", password="password")
result = client.query("MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 10")
```

## Development

When adding new database components, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a dedicated directory for each database type
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add unit tests in the corresponding test directory
4. Ensure compatibility with the core TTA framework
