# Project Memory & Learnings

This file serves as the long-term memory for AI agents working on this project. It captures architectural decisions, recurring issues, and successful patterns that should be carried forward to future sessions.

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Primitives First:** Always use `tta-dev-primitives` for workflows.
- **Type Safety:** Python 3.11+ with strict type hints (`str | None`).
- **Testing:** 100% coverage for new code using `pytest` and `MockPrimitive`.
- **Observability:** Use `WorkflowContext` and `InstrumentedPrimitive`.

## 🏗️ Architectural Decisions

- **Monorepo Structure:** Packages in `platform/`, apps in `apps/`.
- **Dependency Management:** Use `uv` for all Python package management.
- **Agentic Runtimes:** Use `gemini` CLI via `scripts/run_agent.py` wrapper.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

- **Gemini CLI OOM:** Large diffs/contexts can cause Node.js OOM. Use `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"` and truncate inputs.
- **Gemini CLI 404:** Use `gemini-2.5-flash` model instead of experimental versions.

## 📝 Active Context

- **Current Phase:** Phase 3 (Automation & Continuous Improvement).
- **Focus:** Establishing reliable CI/CD pipelines for agentic workflows.

## 🔄 Feedback Loop
