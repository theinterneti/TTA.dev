# python-pathway Package Status

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Under Review
**Decision Deadline:** November 7, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025

---

## Current State

### What Exists
- Directory structure: `packages/python-pathway/`
- Folders: `chatmodes/`, `workflows/`
- File: `shell.nix` (Nix configuration)

### What's Missing
- ‚ùå No `pyproject.toml` - Not a proper Python package
- ‚ùå No `src/` directory - No source code
- ‚ùå No test suite
- ‚ùå No README.md - Completely undocumented
- ‚ùå No clear purpose or use case
- ‚ùå Not included in workspace configuration

---

## Purpose (Unclear)

**Documentation says:** "Python code analysis utilities"

**Reality:** Unclear what this does or why it exists.

**Questions:**
- What Python analysis features?
- How does it relate to TTA.dev?
- What problem does it solve?
- Who would use this?

---

## Integration Status

### With tta-dev-primitives
- **Status:** ‚ùå None
- **Issue:** No code to integrate
- **Gap:** No clear integration point

### Documentation References
- Mentioned in: AGENTS.md, COMPONENT_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md
- Reality: Empty directory structure with Nix file

---

## Investigation Needed

Before making a decision, need to understand:

1. **What's in chatmodes/ and workflows/?**
   - Are these utilities or examples?
   - Do they provide value?

2. **Is this related to a specific use case?**
   - Code analysis for AI agents?
   - Python AST manipulation?
   - Static analysis tools?

3. **Is there existing functionality elsewhere?**
   - Does tta-dev-primitives already cover this?
   - Are there better external tools?

---

## Decision Options

### Option A: Define Clear Purpose ‚úÖ
**Effort:** Medium (1-2 weeks)
**Requirements:**
1. Document specific use case
2. Create proper package structure
3. Add pyproject.toml
4. Implement core functionality
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Provide usage examples
7. Show integration with primitives (if applicable)

**Example Use Cases:**
- Python code generation for AI workflows
- AST analysis for workflow optimization
- Dynamic primitive generation
- Code quality validation

### Option B: Remove Package ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Effort:** Low (30 minutes)
**Actions:**
1. Delete `packages/python-pathway/`
2. Remove all documentation references
3. Update AGENTS.md
4. Note in CHANGELOG

**Rationale:**
- No clear purpose documented
- Minimal content (just directory structure)
- Not integrated with anything
- No tests or documentation

### Option C: Merge with Existing Package üí°
**Effort:** Low-Medium (depends on content)
**Approach:**
- If chatmodes/workflows are useful, merge into appropriate package
- Add as submodule of tta-dev-primitives or scripts/
- Remove standalone package

---

## Recommendation

**Recommended:** Option B (Remove) unless clear use case can be defined

**Reasoning:**
1. No clear documented purpose
2. Minimal content
3. Not integrated with project architecture
4. No test coverage or documentation
5. Unclear value proposition

**Alternative:** If investigation reveals valuable content, consider Option C

---

## If Continuing Development

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Document clear, specific use case
- [ ] Explain how it fits TTA.dev architecture
- [ ] Create proper package structure:
  ```
  packages/python-pathway/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/python_pathway/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis/    # Python code analysis
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generation/  # Code generation
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/       # Utilities
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
  ```
- [ ] Add pytest test suite
- [ ] Provide real-world examples
- [ ] Show integration with primitives (if applicable)
- [ ] Add to workspace configuration

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks if purpose is clear

---

## Investigation Tasks

Before November 7 decision:

- [ ] Review contents of chatmodes/ and workflows/
- [ ] Search codebase for references to python-pathway
- [ ] Check git history for context on why it was created
- [ ] Evaluate if functionality is needed elsewhere
