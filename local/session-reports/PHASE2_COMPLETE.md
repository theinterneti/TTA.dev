- Included usage patterns, best practices, architecture integration
- Added troubleshooting guide and performance metrics

**LLM Selection Guide**
- Comprehensive OpenAI vs Anthropic vs Ollama comparison
- Decision matrix for 7 priority factors (quality, cost, privacy, speed, context, safety, simplicity)
- Code examples for all 3 primitives
- Cost breakdown and multi-LLM strategy with RouterPrimitive

**Integration Primitives Quickref**

### 2. Architecture Documentation (1 file)

**Component Integration Analysis**
- Analyzed 8 TTA.dev components for primitive integration
- Integration health scores for each component (4/10 to 9/10)
- Identified integration gaps and opportunities

- Created integration health matrix with evaluation criteria

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Excellent: tta-observability-integration (9/10), Testing Infrastructure (9/10)
- ✅ Good: VS Code Toolsets (8/10), MCP Servers (8/10), CI/CD (8/10)
- ⚠️ Partial: universal-agent-context (5/10) - needs AgentPrimitive wrapper
- ⚠️ Minimal: keploy-framework (4/10), python-pathway (4/10)

### 3. Examples Documentation (1 file)

**Examples Overview**
- Documented 13+ working code examples
- Categorized by type: Quick Start, Real-World, Error Handling, Observability, Integration, Orchestration, Specialized
- Included code patterns for composition, error handling, performance optimization
- Provided step-by-step workflow creation guide
- Linked to all example files with descriptions and run commands

**Example Highlights:**
- `observability_demo.py` - Production-ready monitoring with SLO tracking
- `real_world_workflows.py` - Customer support, content generation, data processing, LLM chain
- `error_handling_patterns.py` - Retry, fallback, timeout, combined strategies
- `cost_optimization.py` - 30-40% typical savings
