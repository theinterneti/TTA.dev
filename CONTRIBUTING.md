# Contributing to TTA.dev

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TTA.dev! This project maintains high quality standards to ensure all components are production-ready and battle-tested.

## Philosophy

**Only proven code enters this repository.**

Every component must have:
- ‚úÖ 100% test coverage
- ‚úÖ Real-world production usage
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Zero known critical bugs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Git
- VS Code (recommended)

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA.dev
cd TTA.dev

# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Verify installation
uv run pytest -v
```

## Contribution Process

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

- Check existing [issues](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA.dev/issues)
- Create a new issue if needed, describing:
  - The problem you're solving
  - Your proposed solution
  - Real-world use case
  - Expected impact

### 2. Fork and Branch

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TTA.dev
cd TTA.dev

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Changes

Follow our [Coding Standards](docs/development/CodingStandards.md):

- Write clean, readable code
- Add comprehensive type hints
- Include docstrings (Google style)
- Follow PEP 8 (enforced by Ruff)
- Keep functions focused and small

### 4. Write Tests

**100% test coverage is required.**

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest -v

# Check coverage
uv run pytest --cov=packages --cov-report=html
```

Test requirements:
- Unit tests for all new code
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Docstring examples that work as doctests
- Edge cases and error conditions

### 5. Document Your Changes

Documentation requirements:
- Update relevant README files
- Add docstrings to all public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Update architecture docs if applicable
- Add entry to CHANGELOG.md

### 6. Run Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Lint code
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Type check
uvx pyright packages/

# Run all quality checks
uv run task "‚úÖ Quality Check (All)"
```

All checks must pass before submitting PR.

### 7. Commit Changes

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "feat(primitives): add circuit breaker primitive"
git commit -m "fix(cache): resolve TTL expiration bug"
git commit -m "docs(examples): add LLM chain example"
git commit -m "test(recovery): add retry edge cases"
```

Commit types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 8. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Create a PR with:
- Clear, descriptive title
- Detailed description of changes
- Link to related issues
- Screenshots/examples if applicable
- Checklist of completed items

## Pull Request Checklist

## Style Guide

### Python Code

```python
from typing import Any

from tta_dev_primitives.core.base import WorkflowContext, WorkflowPrimitive


class MyPrimitive(WorkflowPrimitive):
    """One-line summary of what this primitive does.
    
    Longer description with more details about usage, behavior,
    and any important considerations.
    
    Args:
        param: Description of parameter
        
    Example:
        >>> primitive = MyPrimitive()
        >>> result = await primitive.execute(data, context)
        {"status": "success"}
    """
    
    def __init__(self, param: str) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.param = param
    
    async def _execute(
        self,
        data: dict[str, Any],
        context: WorkflowContext
    ) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute the primitive logic."""
        # Implementation
        return {"result": "value"}
```

### Tests

```python
import pytest

from tta_dev_primitives.core.base import WorkflowContext


@pytest.fixture
def context():
    """Create a test workflow context."""
    return WorkflowContext(
        workflow_id="test",
        session_id="test-session"
    )


async def test_my_primitive_success(context):
    """Test that MyPrimitive succeeds with valid input."""
    # Arrange
    primitive = MyPrimitive(param="test")
    data = {"input": "value"}
    
    # Act
    result = await primitive.execute(data, context)
    
    # Assert
    assert result["result"] == "value"
    assert "input" in result


async def test_my_primitive_handles_error(context):
    """Test that MyPrimitive handles errors gracefully."""
    # Arrange
    primitive = MyPrimitive(param="test")
    data = {}  # Missing required field
    
    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Missing required field"):
        await primitive.execute(data, context)
```
