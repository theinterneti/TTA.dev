## 📋 The First Prompt in Detail

### Primary Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)

```text
I need you to become a Logseq documentation expert for my TTA.dev project.

Your role is to help me maintain high-quality Logseq documentation by:
1. Analyzing my Logseq markdown files for common issues
2. Identifying formatting problems, broken links, and structural issues
3. Suggesting fixes and improvements
4. Optionally applying fixes automatically

Context:
- My Logseq graph is located at: `/home/thein/repos/TTA.dev/logseq/`
- I have a custom documentation assistant tool at: `local/logseq-tools/doc_assistant.py`
- The tool can analyze files, detect issues, score quality (0-100), and auto-fix problems

When I ask you to "check my documentation" or "fix my docs", you should:
1. Run the doc_assistant.py tool to analyze all files
2. Show me the quality scores and issues found
3. Explain what the issues mean and why they matter
4. Offer to fix issues (showing what will change first)
5. Apply fixes if I approve

Start by running an analysis of my current Logseq documentation and tell me what you find.
```

### Alternative Entry Points

**Quick Analysis:**
```text
Run the Logseq documentation assistant on my docs and show me the quality scores.
```

**Detailed Review:**
```text
I need a detailed analysis of my Logseq documentation quality. Check all pages and journals, show me the issues, and prioritize what needs fixing first.
```

**Auto-Fix Mode:**
```text
You're my Logseq documentation maintainer. Analyze my docs, identify all fixable issues, and batch-fix them (with my approval).
```

---

## 💡 Example Session Flow

### Session Start

**User:** (Pastes primary prompt)

**AI:** "I'm your Logseq documentation expert. Let me check your docs..."
```bash
cd /home/thein/repos/TTA.dev
python3 local/logseq-tools/doc_assistant.py logseq/
```

### Analysis Phase

**AI:** "📊 Analysis Results:
✅ Analyzed 4 files
⭐ Average score: 87.3/100

Files needing attention:
1. AI Research.md (score: 78.5) - 5 issues (2 errors, 3 warnings)
2. TTA Primitives.md (score: 82.0) - 4 issues
3. TTA.dev (Meta-Project).md (score: 94.2) - 2 info issues

Recommendation: Fix AI Research.md first (lowest score, has errors).

Would you like me to:
A) Show detailed issues for AI Research.md
B) Auto-fix all errors across all files
C) Generate a full report"

### Fix Phase

**User:** "Fix AI Research.md"

**AI:** Shows detailed issues, proposes fixes, asks permission

**User:** "Yes, apply them"

**AI:** Applies fixes, re-analyzes, shows before/after scores, suggests next steps

---

## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Pattern Detection

```text
Are there common issues across all my files? What's my most frequent mistake?
```

### Quality Trends

```text
Track quality scores over time (if I give you multiple analysis runs).
```

### Custom Rules

```text
Also check for [custom rule], like "all TODO items should have a related:: property"
```

### Batch Processing

```text
Check all pages, identify any with quality score < 85, and create a fix plan.
```

---

## 🚨 Safety Rules Built In

1. **Always dry-run first** before applying fixes
2. **Show changes** before applying them
3. **Preserve content** - only fix formatting
4. **Ask permission** for bulk changes
5. **Verify after** - re-analyze to confirm

### What AI CAN Do

- ✅ Analyze any markdown file in logseq/
- ✅ Run the doc_assistant.py tool
- ✅ Suggest and apply fixes
- ✅ Explain issues in detail
- ✅ Prioritize fixes by importance

### What AI CANNOT Do

- ❌ Modify files without permission
- ❌ Delete content (only fix formatting)
- ❌ Change the meaning of content
- ❌ Add new content (except blank lines)
- ❌ Modify Logseq config files

---

## 📊 Quality Standards

### Issue Types

**Errors (Fix Immediately):**
- `task_case`: Task status not uppercase (todo → TODO)
- `heading_format`: Missing space after # in headings
- `code_unclosed`: Unclosed code blocks

**Warnings (Should Fix):**
- `heading_skip`: Skipped heading levels (# → ###)
- `list_spacing`: Missing blank lines around lists
- `code_language`: Code blocks missing language specifier

**Info (Nice to Fix):**
- `bare_url`: Bare URLs that should be wrapped

### Scoring

- **90-100**: Excellent
- **75-89**: Good
- **60-74**: Acceptable
- **Below 60**: Needs work

**Deductions:**
- Errors: -10 points each
- Warnings: -5 points each
- Info: -1 point each
