# Core

This directory contains core components for the TTA.dev framework. These are the foundational components that other modules build upon.

## Overview

The core directory includes:

- Base classes and interfaces
- Configuration management
- Logging and monitoring utilities
- Error handling and exception classes
- Common utilities and helper functions

## Usage

Core components can be imported and used in your applications:

```python
from tta.dev.core import Config

config = Config.load_from_file("config.yaml")
logger = config.get_logger("my_module")
```

## Development

When adding new core components, please follow these guidelines:

1. Keep dependencies minimal
2. Ensure high test coverage
3. Document all public APIs thoroughly
4. Consider backward compatibility
