# AI Context Optimizer - Quick Start Guide

**Time to complete:** 5 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Prerequisites:** Git, AI coding assistant (Copilot, Claude, Gemini, or Augment)

---

## What You'll Get

After this 5-minute setup, your AI assistant will:

âœ… Automatically follow your project's coding standards  
âœ… Use correct syntax and patterns for your tech stack  
âœ… Suggest tests that match your testing framework  
âœ… Apply security best practices automatically  
âœ… Switch between specialized roles (backend, frontend, DevOps, etc.)

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Setup (30 seconds)

Pick the option that matches your needs:

### Option A: Basic Setup (Most Common)
**Best for:** General development with any AI assistant  
**What you get:** Project instructions + coding standards  
**Time:** 2 minutes

### Option B: Advanced Setup (Augment Users)
**Best for:** Augment CLI users wanting advanced features  
**What you get:** Everything + context management + Augster AI personality  
**Time:** 5 minutes

### Option C: Full Setup (Power Users)
**Best for:** Maximum flexibility and all features  
**What you get:** Everything from A and B  
**Time:** 3 minutes

---

## Step 2: Install (2-3 minutes)

Open your terminal and navigate to your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### Option A: Basic Setup

```bash
# Copy the cross-platform primitives
cp -r /path/to/TTA.dev/packages/universal-agent-context/.github/ .
cp /path/to/TTA.dev/packages/universal-agent-context/AGENTS.md .

# Done! Verify it worked:
ls -la .github/instructions/
```

**Expected output:** You should see several `.instructions.md` files

### Option B: Advanced Setup (Augment CLI)

```bash
# Copy Augment-specific primitives
cp -r /path/to/TTA.dev/packages/universal-agent-context/.augment/ .
cp /path/to/TTA.dev/packages/universal-agent-context/apm.yml .

# Initialize context management (optional)
python .augment/context/cli.py new $(basename $(pwd))

# Done! Verify it worked:
ls -la .augment/instructions/
```

**Expected output:** You should see several `.instructions.md` files

### Option C: Full Setup

```bash
# Copy everything
cp -r /path/to/TTA.dev/packages/universal-agent-context/.github/ .
cp -r /path/to/TTA.dev/packages/universal-agent-context/.augment/ .
cp /path/to/TTA.dev/packages/universal-agent-context/AGENTS.md .
cp /path/to/TTA.dev/packages/universal-agent-context/apm.yml .

# Done! Verify it worked:
ls -la .github/instructions/ .augment/instructions/
```

**Expected output:** You should see instruction files in both directories

---

## Step 3: Test It (1 minute)

### Quick Test

1. **Open your AI assistant** (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
2. **Type this question:**
   ```
   What Python coding standards should I follow in this project?
   ```
3. **Expected response:** Your AI should mention:
   - Python 3.11+ syntax
   - Type hints with `str | None` (not `Optional[str]`)
   - Google-style docstrings
   - Testing with pytest
   - Specific patterns from your project

**If you see this, you're all set! âœ…**

### Alternative Test (VS Code + Copilot)

1. Create a new Python file: `test_ai.py`
2. Start typing:
   ```python
   def process_user_data(
   ```
3. **Watch Copilot's suggestions** - they should follow your project standards

---

## Step 4: Explore Features (Optional)

### Try a Chat Mode

Chat modes give your AI assistant specialized knowledge for specific tasks.

**Available modes:**
- `backend-dev` - Backend development
- `frontend-dev` - Frontend development
- `devops` - DevOps and infrastructure
- `qa-engineer` - Testing and quality assurance
- `architect` - System architecture

**How to use (if supported by your AI):**
```
Switch to devops chat mode
Help me set up a CI/CD pipeline
```

### Use Context Management (Augment CLI only)

Track important context across sessions:

```bash
# Add important context
python .augment/context/cli.py add my-project "Working on user authentication feature" --importance 1.0

# View context
python .augment/context/cli.py show my-project

# Use in a session
# Context is automatically available to Augment
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "AI doesn't seem to use the instructions"

**Fix:**
1. Restart your AI assistant
2. Ensure files are in the right place: `.github/instructions/`
3. Try a specific question: "What's in the project instructions?"

### Issue: "Can't find the TTA.dev directory"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clone it first
git clone https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA.dev
cd TTA.dev

# Now run the copy commands, replacing /path/to/TTA.dev with your actual path
```

### Issue: "Context CLI doesn't work"

**Fix:**
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (need 3.11+)
2. Ensure `.augment/` directory exists
3. Make script executable: `chmod +x .augment/context/cli.py`

## Next Steps

### Customize for Your Project

Edit instruction files to match your team's specific needs:

```bash
# Edit Python standards
vim .github/instructions/python-quality-standards.instructions.md

# Edit testing requirements
vim .github/instructions/testing-requirements.instructions.md

# Edit security guidelines
vim .github/instructions/api-security.instructions.md
```

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Simple
Don't try to customize everything at once. Use the defaults first, then adjust.

### 2. Share Feedback
Found something that doesn't work? Let us know! Your feedback helps everyone.

### 3. Experiment
Try different chat modes and see what works best for your workflow.

### 4. Keep It Updated
When your team's standards change, update the instruction files.

### 5. Teach Others
Once you're comfortable, help your teammates get set up.

## Examples

### Example 1: Python Function with Instructions

**Without AI Context Optimizer:**
```python
# Your prompt: "Create a function to validate email"
# AI response:
def validate_email(email):
    return "@" in email
```

**With AI Context Optimizer:**
```python
# Your prompt: "Create a function to validate email"
# AI response:
def validate_email(email: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validate email address format.
    
    Args:
        email: Email address to validate
        
    Returns:
        True if email is valid, False otherwise
        
    Example:
        >>> validate_email("user@example.com")
        True
    """
    import re
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    return bool(re.match(pattern, email))
```

### Example 2: Using Chat Modes

**Switching to DevOps mode:**
```
User: "Switch to devops chat mode"
AI: "Switched to DevOps mode. I'll focus on infrastructure, deployment, and operations."

User: "Help me set up CI/CD"
AI: "I'll help you set up a CI/CD pipeline following your project standards..."
[Provides infrastructure-as-code, follows security boundaries, includes monitoring]
```
