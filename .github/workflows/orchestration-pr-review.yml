name: Orchestrated PR Review (DEPRECATED)

# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This workflow is being replaced by consolidated-ai-review.yml
# Will be removed after migration is complete
# See .github/workflows/MIGRATION_PLAN.md for details

# This workflow automatically reviews pull requests using multi-model orchestration
# Orchestrator (Claude) analyzes PR → Executor (Gemini Pro) performs review → Claude validates
# Cost savings: 85%+ vs. using Claude for everything
