## Questions & Clarifications

### Who makes the final selection?

The program manager, with input from technical leads and stakeholders.

### What if we get too many strong applications?

Prioritize based on diversity criteria, then consider expanding pilot size or creating a waitlist for Phase 2.

### Can volunteers recommend others?

Yes! Referrals are welcome but all candidates must complete the application process.

### What if a volunteer isn't a good fit after starting?

We'll work with them to resolve issues. If necessary, we can mutually agree to exit the pilot.
