# Archive

This directory contains historical and legacy code that is no longer part of the core TTA.dev framework but is preserved for reference.

## Contents

### `legacy-tta-game/`

The original TTA (Tiny Thinking Agent) game project. This was an early exploration of agentic systems that informed the development of the current TTA.dev framework primitives.

**Status**: Historical artifact, not maintained  
**Purpose**: Reference for understanding the evolution of TTA.dev  
**Original Branch**: Pre-framework refactor

## Why Archive?

Code is moved to this archive when:
1. It's no longer part of the core framework
2. It represents an interesting historical exploration
3. It might be useful for reference or revival later
4. Deleting it would lose valuable context

## Using Archived Code

Archived code is **not supported** and may not work with current dependencies. Use at your own risk, primarily for reference and learning.

If you want to revive archived code:
1. Copy it to a new location
2. Update dependencies and APIs to match current framework
3. Add tests
4. Submit as a new contribution

## Framework Evolution
