# TasksPrimitive Real-World Experiment

**Date:** November 4, 2025
**Goal:** Test TasksPrimitive with actual TTA.dev project planning

## Experiment Scenarios

### 1. Feature Planning: API Monitoring Dashboard
A real feature we might build - demonstrates complex dependencies and parallel work.

### 2. Refactoring Project: Observability Enhancement
Actual technical debt item - shows how TasksPrimitive handles technical work.

### 3. Cross-Package Integration: New Primitive Family
Real architectural work - tests task breakdown for architectural changes.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Generate actionable tasks we could actually execute
- [ ] Identify realistic dependencies
- [ ] Calculate accurate effort estimates
- [ ] Find parallel work opportunities
- [ ] Export in format suitable for GitHub Issues

## Results

To be filled in after running experiments...
