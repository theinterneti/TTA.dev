- ### Summary
  - `SequentialPrimitive` executes a list of `[[TTA.dev/Concepts/WorkflowPrimitive]]` instances in order, where the output of one primitive becomes the input for the next.
- ### Logic
  - It takes a list of primitives during initialization.
  - The `_execute_impl` method iterates through these primitives, calling `execute` on each.
  - It handles passing the output of the previous primitive as input to the current one.
  - Includes extensive logging, metrics, and tracing for each step, leveraging `[[TTA.dev/Data/WorkflowContext]]` for context propagation.
  - Supports the `>>` operator for intuitive sequential composition.
