# Getting Started with TTA.dev

**Build reliable AI applications with production-ready primitives and patterns.**

## What is TTA.dev?

TTA.dev is a collection of battle-tested components for building AI-native applications. Every component has:
- ✅ 100% test coverage
- ✅ Production usage validation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Observable and debuggable

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install tta-dev-primitives

# Or with uv (recommended)
uv pip install tta-dev-primitives
```

### 2. Your First Workflow

```python
from tta_dev_primitives import (
    CachePrimitive,
    RouterPrimitive,
    RetryPrimitive,
    WorkflowContext
)

# Define your processing function
async def process_with_llm(data: dict, context: WorkflowContext) -> dict:
    # Your LLM call here
    return {"result": "processed"}

# Compose workflow with operators
workflow = (
    CachePrimitive(ttl=3600) >>      # Cache for 1 hour
    RouterPrimitive(tier="balanced") >> # Smart model selection
    RetryPrimitive(max_attempts=3) >>   # Retry on failure
    process_with_llm
)

# Execute
context = WorkflowContext(trace_id="request-123")
result = await workflow.execute({"input": "Hello"}, context)
```

### 3. See Results

Your workflow now has:
- ✅ Automatic caching (30-40% cost reduction)
- ✅ Smart routing to appropriate models
- ✅ Retry logic for transient failures
- ✅ Full observability with traces

## Core Concepts

### Primitives

Small, composable building blocks for workflows:

- **Router**: Choose models based on tier (fast/balanced/quality)
- **Cache**: LRU caching with TTL to reduce costs
- **Retry**: Exponential backoff for reliability
- **Timeout**: Circuit breaker pattern
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation

### Composition

Combine primitives using operators:

```python
# Sequential: Execute in order
workflow = step1 >> step2 >> step3

# Parallel: Execute concurrently
workflow = step1 | step2 | step3

# Conditional: Branch based on data
workflow = router >> (fast_path if simple else complex_path)
```

### Context

Every execution has context for tracing and correlation:

```python
context = WorkflowContext(
    trace_id="abc-123",
    correlation_id="request-456",
    metadata={"user_id": "user123"}
)
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Cached LLM Pipeline

```python
from tta_dev_primitives import CachePrimitive, RouterPrimitive

async def analyze_text(text: str) -> dict:
    workflow = (
        CachePrimitive(ttl=3600) >>
        RouterPrimitive(tier="balanced") >>
        llm_analyzer
    )

    return await workflow.execute(
        {"text": text},
        WorkflowContext()
    )
```

### Pattern 2: Resilient API Call

```python
from tta_dev_primitives import RetryPrimitive, TimeoutPrimitive, FallbackPrimitive

workflow = (
    TimeoutPrimitive(seconds=10) >>
    RetryPrimitive(max_attempts=3, backoff_factor=2.0) >>
    FallbackPrimitive(
        primary=expensive_api,
        fallback=cheap_api
    )
)
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Processing

```python
from tta_dev_primitives import ParallelPrimitive

# Fetch data from multiple sources concurrently
workflow = ParallelPrimitive([
    fetch_user_profile,
    fetch_recommendations,
    fetch_analytics
])

results = await workflow.execute({"user_id": 123}, context)
```

## Cost Optimization

### Smart Caching

```python
# Cache reduces redundant LLM calls by 30-40%
cache = CachePrimitive(
    ttl=3600,              # 1 hour
    max_size=1000,         # Max 1000 entries
    context_aware=True     # Include context in cache key
)
```

### Tiered Routing

```python
# Route to appropriate model based on complexity
router = RouterPrimitive(
    tier="fast",      # Use cheaper, faster model
    # tier="balanced" # Balance cost and quality
    # tier="quality"  # Use best model for hard tasks
)
```

## Observability

### OpenTelemetry Integration

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from tta_dev_primitives import WorkflowContext

# Context automatically propagates traces
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_operation") as span:
    context = WorkflowContext(
        trace_id=span.get_span_context().trace_id
    )
    result = await workflow.execute(data, context)
```

### Structured Logging

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Context provides correlation IDs
logger.info(
    "Workflow completed",
    extra={
        "trace_id": context.trace_id,
        "duration_ms": duration,
        "cache_hit": True
    }
)
```

## Testing

### Testing Your Workflows

```python
from tta_dev_primitives.testing import MockPrimitive, create_test_context

async def test_my_workflow():
    # Use mocks for testing
    mock_llm = MockPrimitive(
        response={"result": "test response"}
    )

    workflow = cache >> mock_llm >> processor

    context = create_test_context(trace_id="test-123")
    result = await workflow.execute({"input": "test"}, context)

    assert result["result"] == "processed test response"
    assert mock_llm.call_count == 1
```

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Primitives

Create your own primitives:

```python
from tta_dev_primitives import WorkflowPrimitive, WorkflowContext

class CustomPrimitive(WorkflowPrimitive):
    """Your custom primitive."""

    async def _execute(
        self,
        data: dict,
        context: WorkflowContext
    ) -> dict:
        # Your implementation
        return processed_data
```

### Performance Tuning

Tips for optimal performance:

1. **Use caching aggressively** - Cache at multiple levels
2. **Choose appropriate tiers** - Use fast tier for simple tasks
3. **Parallel execution** - Run independent operations concurrently
4. **Monitor metrics** - Track cache hit rate, latency, costs
5. **Profile before optimizing** - Measure to find bottlenecks
