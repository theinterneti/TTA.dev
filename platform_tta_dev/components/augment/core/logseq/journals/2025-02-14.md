alias:: Host-aware .env follow-up (local)
tags:: #tta/logseq #devlog #env-overlays

- **Context**: Still need to finish documenting the host-aware `.env` overlay workflow inside the shared Logseq graph, but the canonical journals directory under `TTA-notes` isnt accessible from this repo snapshot, so parking the notes here until the real path is available.
- **References**: [[docs/development/environment-overlays.md]], [[scripts/env/generate_env.py]], [[scripts/env/bootstrap_secrets.py]]
- **Next steps**
  - TODO Confirm the actual `TTA-notes/logseq/journals/` location (or equivalent symlink) so these notes can be moved into the canonical graph.
  - TODO Capture a short how-to for `scripts/env/bootstrap_secrets.py --profile <name>` with concrete destination paths (e.g., `~/.config/tta/secrets/<profile>.env`) and link it back to the Logseq knowledge base.
  - TODO Run `scripts/env/generate_env.py` with the new host-aware overlays (`wsl-dev`, `remote-dev`, etc.), export the merged key/value diff, and attach the results to the Logseq entry once the graph is reachable.
  - TODO Add the validation commands (`uv run python scripts/test_database_connections.py`, `uv run python scripts/verify_docker_runtime_setup.py`) as executable blocks in the journal so future runs have a single place to copy/paste from.
- **Blockers**: Need confirmation on whether the shared graph will surface `.augment/logseq/journals/*` directly or if we should push entries through the `/home/thein/repos/TTA-notes/logseq/journals/` path before syncing.
