# AI Context Optimizer Pilot Program

**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Owner**: TTA.dev Team

---

## Overview

The AI Context Optimizer pilot program aims to evaluate the effectiveness of context optimization techniques for AI-powered development workflows. This program will test token reduction strategies while maintaining or improving developer productivity and satisfaction.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Reduce Token Consumption**: Achieve 20-40% reduction in token usage across typical development workflows
2. **Maintain Developer Velocity**: Ensure no negative impact on development speed
3. **Preserve Code Quality**: Maintain or improve code quality metrics
4. **Enhance Developer Experience**: Improve satisfaction with AI interactions

### Secondary Goals

1. Identify optimal context optimization patterns
2. Establish best practices for context management
3. Create reusable optimization templates
4. Build metrics dashboard for monitoring

## Program Structure

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)

- [ ] Recruit pilot volunteers
- [ ] Baseline measurement collection
- [ ] Setup tracking infrastructure
- [ ] Distribute optimization guidelines

### Phase 2: Active Pilot (Weeks 2-4)

- [ ] Deploy context optimizer to pilot group
- [ ] Weekly check-ins and feedback sessions
- [ ] Continuous metric collection
- [ ] Issue tracking and resolution

### Phase 3: Evaluation (Week 5)

- [ ] Analyze collected metrics
- [ ] Synthesize feedback
- [ ] Compare baseline vs. pilot performance
- [ ] Identify optimization patterns

### Phase 4: Decision (Week 6)

- [ ] Review findings with stakeholders
- [ ] Make go/no-go decision
- [ ] Plan rollout strategy (if go)
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## FAQ

### Q: How much time will this require?

**A**: Approximately 2-3 hours total over 4-6 weeks, mostly for check-ins and surveys. Daily usage is part of your normal development work.

### Q: What if I can't complete the full pilot?

**A**: That's okay! Any participation helps. We'll collect data for as long as you can participate.

### Q: Will this slow down my development?

**A**: No. The optimizer is designed to maintain or improve development velocity while reducing token consumption.

### Q: What data will be collected?

**A**: Token usage metrics, response times, and satisfaction surveys. No code or personal data is collected.

### Q: Can I opt out at any time?

**A**: Yes, participation is completely voluntary and you can opt out at any time.
