# TTA.dev Source Code

This directory contains the source code for the TTA.dev framework, which provides reusable components for working with AI, agents, agentic RAG, database integrations, and building a local LLM coding agent network.

## Directory Structure

- **agents/**: Agent components and frameworks
- **models/**: Model integrations and abstractions
- **knowledge/**: Knowledge graph and RAG components
- **database/**: Database integration components
- **tools/**: Tool integration components
- **core/**: Core framework components

## Overview

The TTA.dev framework is designed to provide reusable components that can be integrated into various applications. The framework is organized around the following principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be used independently or together
2. **Extensibility**: The framework can be extended with new components
3. **Interoperability**: Components can work together seamlessly
4. **Testability**: Components are designed to be easily testable

## Getting Started

To use the TTA.dev framework:

```python
# Import components
from tta.dev.agents import Agent
from tta.dev.models import LLMClient
from tta.dev.knowledge import KnowledgeGraph

# Initialize components
agent = Agent(...)
client = LLMClient(...)
kg = KnowledgeGraph(...)

# Use components together
result = agent.run(client, kg, ...)
```

## Development

When developing new components for the TTA.dev framework:

1. Place components in the appropriate directory
2. Follow the existing patterns and conventions
3. Include comprehensive documentation
4. Add unit tests in the corresponding test directory
