- ### Summary
  - `FallbackPrimitive` attempts to execute a primary `[[TTA.dev/Concepts/WorkflowPrimitive]]` and, if it fails, automatically switches to an alternative fallback primitive.
- ### Logic
  - It takes a `primary` primitive and a `fallback` primitive during initialization.
  - The `execute` method first attempts to run the `primary` primitive.
  - If the `primary` primitive raises an exception, the `fallback` primitive is executed with the same input and context.
  - Includes comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing for both primary and fallback execution paths, leveraging `[[TTA.dev/Data/WorkflowContext]]`.
