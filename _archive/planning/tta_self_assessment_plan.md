# TTA.dev Self-Assessment Plan

## Assessment Objectives

- Evaluate TTA.dev's core capabilities and architecture
- Assess Cline integration quality and implementation
- Test primitives and workflow patterns
- Generate comprehensive assessment report

## Assessment Steps

### Phase 1: Project Understanding

- [ ] Read core documentation (AGENTS.md, PRIMITIVES_CATALOG.md, GETTING_STARTED.md)
- [ ] Analyze project structure and architecture
- [ ] Review package dependencies and organization

### Phase 2: Core Primitives Analysis

- [ ] Examine tta-dev-primitives implementation
- [ ] Test workflow composition patterns
- [ ] Evaluate recovery and performance primitives
- [ ] Assess testing frameworks

### Phase 3: Cline Integration Assessment

- [ ] Review Cline integration files and patterns
- [ ] Analyze .clinerules compliance
- [ ] Test Cline-specific capabilities
- [ ] Evaluate integration completeness

### Phase 4: Self-Assessment Using Primitives

- [ ] Create assessment workflow using TTA.dev primitives
- [ ] Run automated testing and validation
- [ ] Generate metrics and performance data
- [ ] Document findings and recommendations

### Phase 5: Final Report

- [ ] Compile comprehensive assessment report
- [ ] Provide actionable recommendations
- [ ] Identify strengths and improvement areas
