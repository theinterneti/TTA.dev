# Gemini CLI Write Permissions Fix

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Issue**: Write operations failing with API error retry loop  
**Root Cause**: Insufficient GitHub workflow permissions  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (PR #73)

---

## 🎯 Problem Summary

### Failed Test

**Workflow Run**: [#18978922410](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA.dev/actions/runs/18978922410)  
**Command**: Create file + PR  
**Duration**: 15 minutes 42 seconds  
**Result**: ❌ CANCELLED (retry loop)

**Test Command**:
```markdown
@gemini-cli Create a test file at docs/test-gemini-write.md with the content 
"This file was created by Gemini CLI on October 31, 2025 to verify write capabilities. 
The GitHub MCP server v0.20.1 supports file creation, commits, and PR creation." 
Create a PR titled "test: verify Gemini CLI write capabilities".
```

### Error Pattern

```
[API Error: Exiting due to an error processing the @ command.]
Exiting due to an error processing the @ command.
```

**Repeated every ~2 seconds for 15+ minutes** (same pattern as v0.18.0 timeout issue)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

1. **Checked for regression**: No workflow changes between successful and failed tests
2. **Compared commands**: Read operations worked, write operations failed
3. **Analyzed permissions**: Found `contents: 'read'` in workflow (lines 24 and 37)

### The Problem

**Workflow permissions were set to READ ONLY**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/gemini-invoke.yml (line 24)
permissions:
  contents: 'read'  # ❌ Cannot create files, branches, or commits!
  id-token: 'write'
  issues: 'write'
  pull-requests: 'write'
```

**GitHub App token also had READ ONLY permissions**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/gemini-invoke.yml (line 37)
with:
  app-id: '${{ vars.APP_ID }}'
  private-key: '${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}'
  permission-contents: 'read'  # ❌ Cannot create files, branches, or commits!
  permission-issues: 'write'
  permission-pull-requests: 'write'
```

### Why This Caused Failures

The MCP server tools require `contents: write` permission:

| Tool | Purpose | Required Permission |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `create_or_update_file` | Create/modify files | `contents: write` |
| `push_files` | Commit and push changes | `contents: write` |
| `create_branch` | Create new branches | `contents: write` |
| `create_pull_request` | Create PRs | `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` |
| `delete_file` | Delete files | `contents: write` |

**Without `contents: write`**, these tools fail with API errors, causing the retry loop.

## ✅ Solution

### Changes Made

**PR #73**: [fix: enable write permissions for Gemini CLI write operations](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA.dev/pull/73)

**Changed workflow permissions**:
```yaml
# Before (❌ FAILED)
permissions:
  contents: 'read'

# After (✅ FIXED)
permissions:
  contents: 'write'  # Required for file creation, commits, and branch creation
```

**Changed GitHub App token permissions**:
```yaml
# Before (❌ FAILED)
permission-contents: 'read'

# After (✅ FIXED)
permission-contents: 'write'  # Required for file creation, commits, and branch creation
```

### Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/gemini-invoke.yml` (2 lines changed)
  - Line 24: `contents: 'read'` → `contents: 'write'`
  - Line 37: `permission-contents: 'read'` → `permission-contents: 'write'`

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Retry Write Capability Test

Once PR #73 is merged, retry the same test command:

```markdown
@gemini-cli Create a test file at docs/test-gemini-write.md with the content 
"This file was created by Gemini CLI on October 31, 2025 to verify write capabilities. 
The GitHub MCP server v0.20.1 supports file creation, commits, and PR creation." 
Create a PR titled "test: verify Gemini CLI write capabilities".
```

### Expected Outcome

- ✅ New branch created (e.g., `gemini-cli/test-write-capabilities`)
- ✅ File created with specified content
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed
- ✅ PR opened with title
- ✅ Comment posted with PR link
- ✅ Execution time: 1-2 minutes (not 15+ minutes)

### Success Criteria

1. ✅ Workflow completes without retry loop
2. ✅ File is created in repository
3. ✅ PR is opened successfully
4. ✅ Execution time < 5 minutes
5. ✅ No API errors in logs

---

## 🔒 Security Implications

### Write Operations Are Still Secure

**All safeguards remain in place**:

1. ✅ **PR Review Required**: All changes go through PR review before merging
2. ✅ **Audit Trail**: All changes are auditable via Git history
3. ✅ **Tool Whitelisting**: MCP server tools are explicitly whitelisted (lines 108-127)
4. ✅ **No Workflow Modification**: Cannot modify `.github/workflows/`
5. ✅ **No Secrets Access**: Cannot access repository secrets
6. ✅ **Logged Operations**: All operations are logged in workflow runs

### What Changed

**Before**: Gemini CLI could only READ repository contents  
**After**: Gemini CLI can CREATE files, branches, and PRs (but still requires review to merge)

**Risk Level**: **LOW** - All write operations create PRs that require human review

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Key Insights

1. **Always check permissions first** when debugging API errors
2. **Read vs Write permissions** are critical for MCP server tools
3. **Error patterns can be misleading** - same error as v0.18.0 but different root cause
4. **Documentation assumptions** should be verified against actual configuration
5. **Testing reveals gaps** - initial assessment was incorrect

### Best Practices

1. ✅ **Test incrementally**: Start with read-only, then enable write
2. ✅ **Check permissions**: Verify workflow and token permissions match requirements
3. ✅ **Document thoroughly**: Capture investigation process and findings
4. ✅ **Security first**: Maintain PR review requirement for all write operations
5. ✅ **Iterate quickly**: Fix, test, document, repeat

---

**Status**: ✅ Root cause identified and fixed  
**Next Step**: Merge PR #73 and retry write capability test  
**Expected Impact**: Unlock full Gemini CLI automation potential 🚀
