- ### Summary
  - `RetryStrategy` is a dataclass that defines the configuration for how a `[[TTA.dev/Graph/RetryPrimitive]]` should behave when retrying a failed operation.
- ### Fields
  - `max_retries`: The maximum number of times to retry the primitive.
  - `backoff_base`: The base for exponential backoff calculation (e.g., 2.0 for 2, 4, 8... seconds).
  - `max_backoff`: The maximum delay in seconds between retries.
  - `jitter`: A boolean indicating whether to add random jitter to the backoff delay to prevent thundering herd problems.
