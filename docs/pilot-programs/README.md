## Active Pilots

### [AI Context Optimizer](ai-context-optimizer/)

**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks

Evaluates context optimization techniques for AI-powered development workflows, aiming for 20-40% token reduction while maintaining developer productivity.

**Key Documents**:
- [Program Overview](ai-context-optimizer/README.md)
- [Volunteer Selection](ai-context-optimizer/volunteer-criteria.md)
- [Success Metrics](ai-context-optimizer/success-metrics.md)
- [Feedback Collection](ai-context-optimizer/feedback-template.md)

## Pilot Program Framework

### Purpose

Pilot programs allow us to:
- Test new features with real users before broad rollout
- Gather quantitative and qualitative feedback
- Identify issues and improvements early
- Make data-driven go/no-go decisions
- Build user confidence and adoption

### Standard Process

1. **Planning** (1 week)
   - Define objectives and success criteria
   - Recruit volunteers
   - Setup infrastructure

2. **Execution** (4-6 weeks)
   - Active pilot with selected users
   - Regular check-ins and feedback
   - Issue tracking and resolution
   - Continuous metric collection

3. **Evaluation** (1 week)
   - Analyze data and feedback
   - Synthesize findings
   - Compare against success criteria

4. **Decision** (1 week)
   - Review with stakeholders
   - Make go/no-go decision
   - Plan rollout or iteration

### Success Criteria

All pilots must define:
- **Quantitative metrics**: Measurable targets (e.g., performance, usage)
- **Qualitative feedback**: User satisfaction and experience
- **Retention goals**: Pilot completion rates
- **Go/no-go thresholds**: Clear decision criteria

## Running a Pilot

### Prerequisites

Before starting a pilot:
- [ ] Clear objectives and success metrics defined
- [ ] Volunteer selection criteria established
- [ ] Feedback collection plan created
- [ ] Decision framework agreed upon
- [ ] Infrastructure and support ready

### Using This Template

When creating a new pilot:

1. **Copy the AI Context Optimizer structure**:
   ```bash
   cp -r docs/pilot-programs/ai-context-optimizer docs/pilot-programs/your-pilot-name
   ```

2. **Customize the documents**:
   - Update README.md with your pilot specifics
   - Adjust volunteer criteria for your needs
   - Define relevant success metrics
   - Adapt feedback templates
   - Customize decision framework

3. **Update this index**:
   - Add your pilot to the "Active Pilots" section
   - Link to your pilot directory

### Document Templates

Each pilot should include:

| Document | Purpose | Template |
|----------|---------|----------|
| README.md | Program overview and timeline | [Example](ai-context-optimizer/README.md) |
| volunteer-criteria.md | Selection process and profiles | [Example](ai-context-optimizer/volunteer-criteria.md) |
| success-metrics.md | Quantitative and qualitative metrics | [Example](ai-context-optimizer/success-metrics.md) |
| feedback-template.md | Surveys and collection methods | [Example](ai-context-optimizer/feedback-template.md) |
| rollout-decision.md | Decision-making framework | [Example](ai-context-optimizer/rollout-decision.md) |

## Best Practices

### Volunteer Selection

- **Diversity**: Include users with different experience levels and use cases
- **Commitment**: Ensure volunteers can dedicate necessary time
- **Communication**: Establish clear expectations upfront
- **Support**: Provide adequate resources and responsiveness

### Metric Collection

- **Automated**: Collect quantitative metrics automatically where possible
- **Regular**: Schedule consistent feedback collection points
- **Lightweight**: Keep surveys short and focused
- **Actionable**: Ask questions that can inform decisions

### Communication

- **Transparent**: Share progress and challenges openly
- **Regular**: Maintain consistent communication cadence
- **Bidirectional**: Listen actively and respond to feedback
- **Appreciative**: Recognize and thank volunteers frequently

### Decision Making

- **Data-driven**: Base decisions on metrics and feedback
- **Objective**: Use pre-defined criteria, not post-hoc justification
- **Timely**: Make decisions on schedule to maintain momentum
- **Documented**: Record decision rationale for future reference
