- ### Summary
  - `ConditionalPrimitive` enables branching logic within a workflow, executing one of two `[[TTA.dev/Concepts/WorkflowPrimitive]]` instances based on the evaluation of a condition function.
- ### Logic
  - It takes a `condition` (a callable that returns a boolean), a `then_primitive`, and an optional `else_primitive` during initialization.
  - The `execute` method first evaluates the `condition` with the current input and `[[TTA.dev/Data/WorkflowContext]]`.
  - If the condition is `True`, `then_primitive` is executed. If `False` and `else_primitive` is provided, `else_primitive` is executed. Otherwise, the input is passed through.
  - Includes logging, metrics, and tracing for condition evaluation and branch execution.
