## üéØ Still To Do

### 1. ADR Migration
**Status:** Not started

**Files to Migrate:**
- `docs/architecture/DECISION_RECORDS.md`
- `docs/architecture/MONOREPO_STRUCTURE.md`

**Approach:**
1. Create Logseq pages for each ADR
2. Convert markdown to Logseq format
3. Add proper linking between pages
4. Create index page: [[TTA.dev/Architecture/ADR]]
5. Link from architecture whiteboard

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

### 2. Visual Workflow Diagrams
**Status:** Pending whiteboard creation

**Diagrams Needed:**
1. Sequential composition (>>)
2. Parallel composition (|)
3. Router patterns
4. Recovery patterns cascade
5. Multi-agent coordination

**Format:** PNG/SVG exported from whiteboards

**Estimated Time:** Included in whiteboard creation time

### 3. Phase 4 Completion Checklist

**Remaining Items:**
- [ ] All whiteboards created and exported
- [ ] ADRs migrated to Logseq
- [ ] All 4 How-To guides complete

## üí° Key Insights

### What Worked Well
1. **Template-first approach** - Creating detailed templates before visual work
2. **Comprehensive guides** - 600+ line guides with examples and troubleshooting
3. **Structured tracking** - Decision tracking page with clear criteria
4. **TODO integration** - Following Logseq TODO Management System

### Challenges
1. **Whiteboard creation** - Need Logseq UI for actual visual diagrams
2. **ADR migration** - Significant effort to convert 5 architecture docs
3. **Package decisions** - Require team consensus, not just documentation

### Next Improvements
1. Set up Logseq UI access for whiteboard creation
2. Create ADR migration script/template
3. Schedule package decision meeting with team
