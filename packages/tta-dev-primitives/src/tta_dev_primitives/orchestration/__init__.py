"""Orchestration primitives for multi-model workflows.

This module provides primitives for orchestrating multiple LLM models in a single
workflow, enabling cost optimization through intelligent task delegation.

Key primitives:
- DelegationPrimitive: Delegate tasks from orchestrator to executor models
- TaskClassifierPrimitive: Classify tasks to determine best model
- MultiModelWorkflow: Orchestrate multiple models in a workflow
