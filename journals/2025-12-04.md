## Git Repository Cleanup

### Session Goal
Clean up local git repository structure and establish KB conventions.

### Completed
- [x] Discarded unintentional archive folder modifications
- [x] Established KB structure with `pages/` and `journals/` directories
- [x] Created [[TTA.dev/KB Structure]] page documenting conventions
- [x] Ensured `pages/` and `journals/` are tracked in git

### Decisions Made

1. **KB Directory Structure**
   - `pages/` = Canonical, authoritative KB content
   - `journals/` = Shared thinking space, work-in-progress
   - `logseq/journals/` = Personal notes (gitignored)

2. **Bidirectional Linking Convention**
   - Code → KB: `# See: [[KB Page]]` in docstrings
   - KB → Code: `Source: path/to/file.py` sections
   - Journals link to both code files and KB pages

### Files Modified
- `pages/TTA.dev___KB Structure.md` - NEW
- `journals/2025-12-04.md` - NEW (this file)
