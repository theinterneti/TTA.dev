## 2025-10-20: Test Discovery Flexibility

**Insight:** Quality gates should support flexible test organization patterns

**Context:** Different components use different test organization:
- Some use directory-based: `tests/<component>/`
- Some use single file: `tests/test_<component>.py`
- Some use pattern-based: `tests/test_<component>_*.py`
- Some have naming variations: `orchestration` vs `orchestrator`

**Solution:** Implemented flexible test discovery in `TestCoverageGate` and `TestPassRateGate`:

```python
def _find_test_paths(self) -> list[str]:
    """Find test paths with naming variation support."""
    component_name = self.component_path.name
    test_paths = []

    # Generate naming variations
    name_variations = [component_name]
    if component_name.endswith('ion'):
        name_variations.append(component_name.rstrip('ion') + 'or')
    if component_name.endswith('tion'):
        name_variations.append(component_name.rstrip('tion') + 'tor')

    for name_var in name_variations:
        # Try all patterns
        # ...

    return test_paths
```

**Impact:** Quality gates now work with existing test organization without requiring refactoring

**Best Practice:** Design quality gates to be flexible and accommodate existing patterns

## 2025-10-20: Coverage Scope Precision

**Insight:** Coverage must be scoped to specific component, not entire project

**Problem:** Initial coverage calculation showed 8.3% for 16,034 lines (entire project)

**Root Cause:** Coverage defaulted to project-wide when tests weren't running

**Solution:** Always scope coverage to component:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_component.py \
    --cov=src/component \  # Scope to component
    --cov-report=json \
    --cov-report=term
```

**Result:** Coverage correctly calculated as 29.5% for 652 lines (component only)

**Impact:** Quality gates now accurately measure component-specific coverage

**Best Practice:** Always use `--cov=src/<component>` to scope coverage to specific component

---

## 2025-10-20: Tool Environment Isolation

**Insight:** Use correct tool execution environment for quality gates

**Problem:** Tests failed when using `uvx pytest` due to missing project dependencies

**Root Cause:** `uvx` runs tools in isolated environments without project dependencies

**Solution:** Use appropriate execution method for each tool:

| Tool | Command | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| pytest | `uv run pytest` | Needs project dependencies |
| ruff | `uvx ruff` | Standalone tool |
| pyright | `uvx pyright` | Standalone tool |
| detect-secrets | `uvx detect-secrets` | Standalone tool |

**Impact:** All quality gates now run with proper dependencies

**Best Practice:** Use `uv run` for tools needing project dependencies, `uvx` for standalone tools

---

## 2025-10-20: Auto-Fix for Linting

**Insight:** Auto-fix linting issues when possible to reduce manual work

**Implementation:**
```python
class LintingGate(QualityGate):
    def __init__(self, component_path: Path, auto_fix: bool = False):
        super().__init__(component_path)
        self.auto_fix = auto_fix

    def check(self) -> GateResult:
        if self.auto_fix:
            # Auto-fix linting issues
            subprocess.run(
                ["uvx", "ruff", "check", "--fix", *paths],
                capture_output=True,
            )
            subprocess.run(
                ["uvx", "ruff", "format", *paths],
                capture_output=True,
            )

        # Then run check
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["uvx", "ruff", "check", *paths],
            capture_output=True,
        )
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces manual linting fixes
- Speeds up development workflow
- Ensures consistent code style

**Limitation:** Some issues require manual fixes (e.g., unused imports in complex cases)

**Best Practice:** Enable auto-fix by default, but always run check after to catch remaining issues

## Quality Gate Thresholds

### Coverage Thresholds by Stage

| Stage | Threshold | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Development | ≥60% | Basic coverage for unit tests |
| Staging | ≥70% | Comprehensive coverage including integration |
| Production | ≥80% | High coverage for production reliability |

**Insight:** Thresholds should increase with maturity stage

**Rationale:**
- **Development:** Focus on core functionality, allow rapid iteration
- **Staging:** Ensure integration points are tested
- **Production:** Maximize reliability and minimize bugs

**Adjustment Strategy:**
- Start with lower thresholds for new components
- Gradually increase as component matures
- Never lower thresholds to pass gates (fix the code instead)

---

## Quality Gate Execution Order

### Current Order
1. Test Coverage Gate
2. Test Pass Rate Gate
3. Linting Gate
4. Type Checking Gate
5. Security Gate

**Insight:** Order matters for efficiency and clarity

**Rationale:**
- **Test gates first:** If tests fail, no point checking linting/types
- **Linting before type checking:** Linting is faster, catches simple issues
- **Security last:** Most comprehensive, slowest check

**Optimization Opportunity:** Run gates in parallel for faster execution

---

## Error Handling Patterns

### Pattern: Detailed Error Messages

**Insight:** Quality gate failures should provide actionable information

**Example:**
```python
return GateResult(
    passed=False,
    gate_name="test_coverage",
    threshold=70.0,
    actual_value=29.5,
    message="Coverage: 29.5% (threshold: 70.0%)",
    details={
        "total_statements": 652,
        "covered_statements": 192,
        "missing_lines": 460,
        "files_with_low_coverage": [
            {"file": "core.py", "coverage": 25.0},
            {"file": "utils.py", "coverage": 15.0},
        ]
    }
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Developers know exactly what failed
- Clear path to resolution
- Reduces debugging time

**Best Practice:** Always include threshold, actual value, and actionable details

---

## Quality Gate Configuration

### Component-Specific Overrides

**Insight:** Different components may need different thresholds

**Example:**
```yaml
components:
  orchestration:
    quality_gates:
      test_coverage:
        staging_threshold: 75.0  # Higher for critical component

  player_experience:
    quality_gates:
      test_coverage:
        staging_threshold: 65.0  # Lower for UI component
```

**Rationale:**
- **Critical components:** Higher thresholds for reliability
- **UI components:** Lower thresholds (harder to test)
- **Experimental components:** Lower thresholds initially

**Best Practice:** Document rationale for any threshold overrides

---

## Common Quality Gate Failures

### Failure 1: Low Test Coverage

**Frequency:** Very common (most common failure)

**Typical Causes:**
- Missing tests for error handling
- Edge cases not covered
- Integration tests incomplete

**Resolution:**
1. Identify uncovered lines: `uvx pytest --cov-report=html`
2. Add tests for uncovered code
3. Focus on critical paths first
4. Re-run quality gates

**Prevention:** Write tests alongside implementation

---

### Failure 2: Test Failures

**Frequency:** Common

**Typical Causes:**
- Broken functionality
- Flaky tests
- Missing dependencies
- Environment issues

**Resolution:**
1. Run tests locally: `uvx pytest tests/ -v`
2. Fix failing tests
3. Ensure tests are deterministic
4. Re-run quality gates

**Prevention:** Run tests before committing

---

### Failure 3: Linting Issues

**Frequency:** Occasional (with auto-fix)

**Typical Causes:**
- Code style violations
- Unused imports
- Complex code

**Resolution:**
1. Run auto-fix: `uvx ruff check --fix src/`
2. Run format: `uvx ruff format src/`
3. Fix remaining issues manually
4. Re-run quality gates

**Prevention:** Use pre-commit hooks

---

### Failure 4: Type Checking Errors

**Frequency:** Occasional

**Typical Causes:**
- Missing type hints
- Type mismatches
- Incorrect type annotations

**Resolution:**
1. Run type checker: `uvx pyright src/`
2. Add missing type hints
3. Fix type mismatches
4. Re-run quality gates

**Prevention:** Use type hints from the start

---

### Failure 5: Security Issues

**Frequency:** Rare

**Typical Causes:**
- Hardcoded secrets
- Sensitive data in code
- Accidentally committed credentials

**Resolution:**
1. Run security scan: `uvx detect-secrets scan`
2. Remove secrets from code
3. Update `.secrets.baseline` if false positive
4. Re-run quality gates

**Prevention:** Use pre-commit hooks, environment variables

## Quality Gate Optimization Ideas

### Idea 1: Parallel Execution

**Description:** Run quality gates in parallel instead of sequentially

**Benefits:**
- Faster workflow execution
- Better resource utilization
- Quicker feedback

**Complexity:** Medium

**Implementation:**
```python
import asyncio

async def run_quality_gates_parallel(component_path, target_stage):
    """Run quality gates in parallel."""
    gates = [
        TestCoverageGate(component_path, threshold),
        TestPassRateGate(component_path),
        LintingGate(component_path, auto_fix=True),
        TypeCheckingGate(component_path),
        SecurityGate(component_path),
    ]

    results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        asyncio.to_thread(gate.check) for gate in gates
    ])

    return {result.gate_name: result for result in results}
```

---

### Idea 2: Incremental Checks

**Description:** Only check files that changed since last run

**Benefits:**
- Much faster for small changes
- Encourages frequent quality checks
- Reduces CI/CD time

**Complexity:** High

**Challenges:**
- Need to track file changes
- Need to handle dependencies
- Need to cache results

---

### Idea 3: Quality Gate Dashboard

**Description:** Real-time dashboard showing quality gate status for all components

**Benefits:**
- Visibility into component quality
- Identify components needing attention
- Track quality trends over time

**Complexity:** Medium

**Implementation:** Extend existing observability dashboard
