# Neo4j Schema for TTA Project

    description: "A journal rests on a flat stone in the center of the clearing"
}]->(journal)
```

### HAS_ITEM

Represents that a character possesses an item.

```cypher
MATCH (player:Character {type: "player"}),

    quantity: 1
}]->(journal)
```

}]->(mentor)
```

### HAS_MEMORY

CREATE (mindfulnessQuest)-[:ASSIGNED_TO {
    date_assigned: datetime(),
    progress: 0.33
}]->(player)
```

## Common Query Patterns

### Get Current Location with Contents

```cypher
MATCH (player:Character {type: "player"})-[:LOCATED_AT]->(location:Location)
OPTIONAL MATCH (location)-[containsRel:CONTAINS]->(contained)
RETURN location, containsRel, contained
```

### Get Available Exits

```cypher
MATCH (player:Character {type: "player"})-[:LOCATED_AT]->(location:Location)
MATCH (location)-[exit:EXITS_TO]->(destination:Location)
WHERE exit.accessible = true
RETURN exit.direction, destination.name, exit.description
```

### Get Player Inventory

```cypher
MATCH (player:Character {type: "player"})-[hasItem:HAS_ITEM]->(item:Item)
RETURN item.name, item.description, hasItem.quantity, hasItem.equipped
```

### Get Character Relationships

```cypher
MATCH (player:Character {type: "player"})-[knows:KNOWS]->(character:Character)
RETURN character.name, knows.relationship_type, knows.trust_level
```

### Get Active Quests

```cypher
MATCH (quest:Quest {status: "active"})-[assigned:ASSIGNED_TO]->(player:Character {type: "player"})
RETURN quest.name, quest.objective, assigned.progress
```

### Get Recent Memories

```cypher
MATCH (player:Character {type: "player"})-[remembers:HAS_MEMORY]->(memory:Memory)
RETURN memory.content, memory.type, memory.emotional_valence
ORDER BY memory.timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5
```

## Schema Visualization

```
(Location)-[:EXITS_TO]->(Location)
(Location)-[:CONTAINS]->(Item)
(Location)-[:CONTAINS]->(Character)
(Character)-[:HAS_ITEM]->(Item)
(Character)-[:KNOWS]->(Character)
(Character)-[:HAS_MEMORY]->(Memory)
(Quest)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(Character)
(Character)-[:LOCATED_AT]->(Location)
```

## Schema Evolution

The schema is designed to be extensible. New entity types and relationships can be added as the game evolves:

1. **Emotion Nodes**: To track player emotional states
2. **Skill Nodes**: To represent therapeutic skills learned
3. **Challenge Nodes**: To represent therapeutic challenges
4. **Journal Entry Nodes**: To store player reflections

## Best Practices

1. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
2. **Create Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried properties
3. **Use MERGE for Upserts**: Use MERGE for creating or updating nodes
4. **Batch Updates**: Use batch processing for large updates
5. **Limit Query Depth**: Limit the depth of relationship traversals

## Example Indexes

```cypher
CREATE INDEX location_name_index FOR (l:Location) ON (l.name);
CREATE INDEX item_name_index FOR (i:Item) ON (i.name);
CREATE INDEX character_name_index FOR (c:Character) ON (c.name);
CREATE INDEX memory_timestamp_index FOR (m:Memory) ON (m.timestamp);
```
