# Knowledge

This directory contains knowledge management components for the TTA.dev framework. These are reusable components for working with knowledge graphs, vector databases, and other knowledge storage systems.

## Overview

The knowledge directory includes:

- Knowledge graph abstractions and interfaces
- Vector database integrations
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) components
- Knowledge extraction and processing utilities
- Query and retrieval mechanisms

## Usage

Knowledge components can be imported and used in your applications:

```python
from tta.dev.knowledge import KnowledgeGraph

kg = KnowledgeGraph(provider="neo4j")
kg.add_entity("Entity1", {"property": "value"})
```

## Development

When adding new knowledge components, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a dedicated directory for each knowledge system type
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add unit tests in the corresponding test directory
4. Ensure compatibility with the core TTA framework
