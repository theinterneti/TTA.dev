# Models

This directory contains model integrations and abstractions for the TTA.dev framework. These are reusable components for working with various AI models.

## Overview

The models directory includes:

- Model abstractions and interfaces
- Integration with various model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, etc.)
- Model evaluation and benchmarking tools
- Model fine-tuning utilities
- Caching and optimization strategies

## Usage

Models can be imported and used in your applications:

```python
from tta.dev.models import LLMClient

client = LLMClient(provider="openai", model="gpt-4")
response = client.generate("Hello, world!")
```

## Development

When adding new model components, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a dedicated directory for each model type or provider
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add unit tests in the corresponding test directory
4. Ensure compatibility with the core TTA framework
