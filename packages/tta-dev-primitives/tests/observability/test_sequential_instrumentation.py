"""Tests for SequentialPrimitive Phase 2 instrumentation.

This test suite verifies that SequentialPrimitive provides comprehensive
observability through:
- Step-level span creation
- Structured logging for step execution
- Per-step metrics collection
- Proper checkpoint tracking
- Graceful degradation when OpenTelemetry unavailable
