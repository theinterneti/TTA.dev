# TTA.dev Strategy: Capitalizing on GitHub Agent HQ

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Context:** GitHub Universe 2025 announced Agent HQ - a unified platform for orchestrating multiple AI agents
**Source:** https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/welcome-home-agents/

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

GitHub's Agent HQ announcement creates a **massive strategic opportunity** for TTA.dev. Key alignment:

1. **AGENTS.md standard** - TTA.dev already implements this format
2. **MCP Registry** - TTA.dev has MCP servers ready to publish
3. **Agentic primitives** - TTA.dev's core value prop aligns with GitHub's "primitives you know"
4. **Multi-agent orchestration** - Exactly what TTA.dev is built for
5. **Mission control integration** - New API surface for TTA.dev workflows

**Bottom line:** TTA.dev can position itself as the **premier orchestration framework** for GitHub's Agent HQ ecosystem.
