# Meta-Development Context Management

**Purpose:** Context files for AI agents working across TTA.dev platform and TTA rebuild application
**Strategy:** Systematic complexity management for meta-development approach

---

## 🎯 Current Development Context

### Active Work Stream: Platform Investigation & Documentation

**Focus:** Package status analysis and strategic positioning
**Discoveries:**
- tta-rebuild is reference implementation, not core library
- Meta-development approach using TTA.dev to rebuild TTA
- Natural feedback loop for platform validation

### Agent Context State

**Current Agent Role:** Architecture & Documentation
**Working Areas:**
- Package status investigation
- Dependency analysis
- Strategic documentation
- AI agent complexity management framework

## 📋 Context Switching Protocol

### When Switching to Platform Development:
```markdown
## Platform Context Activation

**Previous Work:** [Brief description]
**Platform Goals:**
- Primitive stability and reusability
- Comprehensive testing
- Developer experience optimization
- API consistency

**Key Considerations:**
- Changes affect multiple consumers
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Performance implications
- Documentation completeness
```

### When Switching to Application Development:
```markdown
## Application Context Activation

**Previous Work:** [Brief description]
**Application Goals:**
- Feature implementation using TTA.dev primitives
- User experience optimization
- Real-world validation of platform
- Identification of platform gaps

**Key Considerations:**
- Platform limitations and workarounds
- Performance under realistic load
- Integration friction points
- New primitive requirements
```

## 📊 Integration Tracking

### Platform Primitives Used in TTA Rebuild:
```yaml
# To be updated as development progresses
primitives_usage:
  - name: "TTAPrimitive"
    status: "implemented"
    performance: "good"
    usage_pattern: "base class for narrative components"
```

### Discovered Patterns:
