## 2025-10-20: Test Discovery Enhancement

**Problem:** Quality gates looked for `tests/orchestration/` but tests were at `tests/test_orchestrator.py`

**Root Cause:** Component name is "orchestration" but test file uses "orchestrator" (naming variation)

**Solution:** Enhanced test discovery to support multiple patterns:
1. Directory-based: `tests/<component>/`
2. Single file: `tests/test_<component>.py`
3. Pattern-based: `tests/test_<component>_*.py`
4. Name variations: Handle suffix transformations (-ion → -or, -tion → -tor)

**Implementation:**
```python
def _find_test_paths(self) -> list[str]:
    """Find test paths with naming variation support."""
    component_name = self.component_path.name
    test_paths = []

    # Generate naming variations
    name_variations = [component_name]
    if component_name.endswith('ion'):
        name_variations.append(component_name.rstrip('ion') + 'or')
    if component_name.endswith('tion'):
        name_variations.append(component_name.rstrip('tion') + 'tor')

    for name_var in name_variations:
        # Try all patterns
        # ...

    return test_paths
```

**Impact:** Workflow now handles flexible test organization without requiring strict naming conventions

**Pattern:** Always check for multiple naming patterns when discovering test files

## 2025-10-20: UV Package Manager - uv run vs uvx

**Problem:** Tests failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytest_asyncio'` when using `uvx pytest`

**Root Cause:** `uvx` runs tools in isolated environments without access to project dependencies

**Solution:** Changed quality gates to use `uv run pytest` instead of `uvx pytest`

**Key Distinction:**
- **`uv run`**: Runs command in project environment with all dependencies
- **`uvx`**: Runs tool in isolated environment (like `npx` for Node.js)

**When to Use:**
- **`uv run pytest`**: For tests (need project dependencies)
- **`uvx ruff`**: For standalone tools (linting, formatting)
- **`uvx pyright`**: For standalone tools (type checking)
- **`uvx detect-secrets`**: For standalone tools (security scanning)

**Impact:** Tests now run with proper dependencies, coverage calculation works correctly

**Pattern:** Use `uv run` for operations that need project dependencies, `uvx` for standalone tools

---

## 2025-10-20: Coverage Calculation Scope

**Problem:** Initial coverage showed 8.3% for 16,034 lines (entire project) instead of component-specific coverage

**Root Cause:** Tests weren't running due to missing pytest-asyncio, so coverage defaulted to project-wide

**Solution:** After fixing dependency access, coverage now correctly scoped to component:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py \
    --cov=src/orchestration \  # Scope to component
    --cov-report=json \
    --cov-report=term
```

**Result:** Coverage correctly calculated as 29.5% for 652 lines (orchestration component only)

**Impact:** Quality gates now accurately measure component-specific coverage

**Pattern:** Always scope coverage to specific component using `--cov=src/<component>`

---

## 2025-10-20: Import Errors in Primitives

**Problem:** `scripts/primitives/__init__.py` tried to import non-existent symbols `CircuitBreakerState` and `CircuitBreakerOpenError`

**Root Cause:** These symbols don't exist in `error_recovery.py`

**Solution:** Removed from imports, only `CircuitBreaker` class exists

**Impact:** Workflow can now import primitives without errors

**Pattern:** Verify all imports exist before adding to `__init__.py`

---

## 2025-10-20: Relative Import Error in Workflow

**Problem:** `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package` when running `spec_to_production.py` as `__main__`

**Root Cause:** Script run as `__main__` can't use relative imports

**Solution:** Changed to absolute imports:
```python
# Before:
from .stage_handlers import (...)

# After:
from scripts.workflow.stage_handlers import (...)
```

**Impact:** Workflow can be run directly as a script

**Pattern:** Use absolute imports for scripts that may be run as `__main__`

---

## 2025-10-20: Workflow Validation Success

**Achievement:** Successfully validated integrated workflow end-to-end with real TTA component (orchestration)

**Key Findings:**
1. ✅ Workflow correctly identified genuine issues (8 test failures, 29.5% coverage)
2. ✅ Quality gates properly enforced thresholds (70% for staging)
3. ✅ All three primitives working together seamlessly
4. ✅ Error recovery attempted appropriately
5. ✅ Observability metrics collected
6. ✅ Comprehensive workflow reports generated

**Validation Results:**
- Specification parsing: ✅ PASSED
- Testing stage: ❌ FAILED (expected - quality gates working)
- Quality gates: ✅ WORKING (prevented deployment of non-compliant component)

**Impact:** Workflow is production-ready and validated with real components

**Pattern:** Test workflows with real components to validate end-to-end functionality

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Hardcoding Test Paths
**Problem:** Hardcoded test paths break when test organization changes
**Solution:** Use flexible test discovery patterns
**Prevention:** Always use `_find_test_paths()` method

### Pitfall 2: Using uvx for Tests
**Problem:** Tests fail due to missing project dependencies
**Solution:** Use `uv run pytest` instead of `uvx pytest`
**Prevention:** Remember: `uv run` for project env, `uvx` for standalone tools

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Quality Gate Failures
**Problem:** Deploying components that don't meet maturity criteria
**Solution:** Fix issues instead of lowering thresholds
**Prevention:** Treat quality gates as hard requirements

### Pitfall 4: Skipping Integration Tests
**Problem:** Components work in isolation but fail when integrated
**Solution:** Write comprehensive integration tests
**Prevention:** Include integration tests in staging criteria

## Questions and Answers

### Q: Should we lower coverage thresholds to pass quality gates?
**A:** No. Fix the code and add tests instead. Quality gates exist to ensure reliability.

### Q: Can we skip integration tests for simple components?
**A:** No. Integration tests validate component interactions, which are critical for system reliability.

### Q: Should we use `uvx` or `uv run` for pytest?
**A:** Use `uv run pytest` for tests (needs project dependencies). Use `uvx` only for standalone tools.

### Q: How do we handle components with dependencies in different stages?
**A:** A component cannot be promoted to a stage higher than its dependencies. Promote dependencies first.
