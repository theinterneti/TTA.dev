# Gemini CLI Hang Investigation - Diagnostic Test

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: üî¨ Diagnostic Test Configuration Complete  
**Branch**: `test/gemini-cli-diagnostics`  
**Related Issues**: #59, #61, #62  
**Baseline Workflow**: [#18953391176](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA.dev/actions/runs/18953391176) (cancelled after 90+ minutes)

---

## Executive Summary

This document tracks the diagnostic investigation into why a simple `@gemini-cli help` command took 60+ minutes to execute in GitHub Actions workflow run #18953391176. Production implementations (Karl Stoney's Autotrader system) complete complex PR reviews in 3-5 minutes, indicating a significant performance issue.

## Diagnostic Configuration

### Changes Applied

Branch `test/gemini-cli-diagnostics` includes the following diagnostic changes to `.github/workflows/gemini-invoke.yml`:

1. ‚úÖ **Telemetry Disabled**
   ```yaml
   "telemetry": {
     "enabled": false
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Rule out GCP telemetry overhead as a bottleneck
   - **Hypothesis**: Telemetry calls to GCP may be causing delays
   - **Previous Setting**: `"enabled": ${{ vars.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT != '' }}`

2. ‚úÖ **Docker Pre-Pull Step**
   ```yaml
   - name: 'Pre-pull GitHub MCP Server Docker Image'
     id: 'prepull_mcp_server'
     run: |-
       echo "üê≥ Pre-pulling GitHub MCP Server image to measure pull time..."
       time docker pull ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:v0.18.0
       echo "‚úÖ Image pull complete"
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Make Docker image pull time visible in logs
   - **Hypothesis**: Image pull may be a significant bottleneck
   - **Measurement**: `time` command will show exact pull duration

3. ‚úÖ **Debug Logging Enabled**
   ```yaml
   gemini_debug: true
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Capture detailed execution traces
   - **Hypothesis**: Debug logs will reveal API latency or other bottlenecks
   - **Previous Setting**: `gemini_debug: '${{ fromJSON(vars.DEBUG || vars.ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG || false) }}'`

### Test Command

```
@gemini-cli help
```

Simple command to establish baseline performance without complex processing.

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Acceptable | Unacceptable |
|--------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Execution Time** | 1-2 minutes | 3-5 minutes | >10 minutes |
| **Baseline** | - | - | 90+ minutes (workflow #18953391176) |
| **Production Reference** | - | 3-5 minutes | - |

**Production Reference**: Karl Stoney's Autotrader system completes complex PR reviews in 3-5 minutes ([source](https://karlstoney.com/building-a-pr-review-agent/))

## Root Cause Hypotheses

### üî¥ HIGH PROBABILITY: Docker Image Pull Overhead

**Evidence**:
- GitHub MCP Server runs in Docker container
- Image: `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:v0.18.0`
- No image caching between workflow runs
- Image pull happens on every invocation

**Diagnostic Measure**: Pre-pull step with timing

**Expected Impact**: If this is the cause, pre-pull time + Gemini CLI time should equal total time

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PROBABILITY: Telemetry Configuration Issues

**Evidence**:
- Telemetry was conditionally enabled based on `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`
- GCP telemetry may add latency for each operation
- Production systems typically disable telemetry in CI/CD

**Diagnostic Measure**: Telemetry completely disabled

**Expected Impact**: If this is the cause, execution time should drop significantly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PROBABILITY: Network/API Latency

**Evidence**:
- GitHub Actions runners may have variable network performance
- Gemini API calls depend on network latency
- Geographic distance between runner and API endpoint matters

**Diagnostic Measure**: Debug logs will show API call timing

**Expected Impact**: If this is the cause, debug logs will show slow API responses

## Test Execution Plan

### Step 1: Trigger Test Workflow

1. Comment `@gemini-cli help` on a test issue
2. Monitor workflow run start
3. Note workflow run ID for later reference

### Step 2: Monitor Workflow Execution

Watch for these key metrics in logs:

1. **Docker Image Pull Time**
   - Look for output from "Pre-pull GitHub MCP Server Docker Image" step
   - `time` command will show: `real`, `user`, `sys` values
   - Expected: 30-60 seconds for first pull

2. **Gemini CLI Execution Time**
   - Look for timestamps in "Run Gemini CLI" step
   - Compare start time to completion time
   - Expected: 1-2 minutes for simple help command

3. **Debug Log Output**
   - Look for detailed API call traces
   - Identify any retry attempts or timeouts
   - Note any error messages or warnings

### Step 3: Analyze Results

Compare execution time with baseline:

- **Baseline**: 90+ minutes (workflow #18953391176)
- **Target**: 1-2 minutes
- **Acceptable**: 3-5 minutes

### Step 4: Document Findings

Update this document with:
- Actual execution time
- Docker image pull time
- Key observations from debug logs
- Confirmed or ruled-out hypotheses

## Previous Investigation Findings

### What We Ruled Out

1. **Approval Prompt Theory** - ‚ùå RULED OUT
   - GitHub Action uses `--yolo` flag (line 283 of action.yml)
   - This automatically accepts all tool executions
   - Equivalent to `tools.autoAccept: true` in settings

2. **Missing Settings** - ‚ùå NOT THE CAUSE
   - Settings are passed via workflow configuration
   - `--yolo` flag overrides settings anyway

### Configuration Comparison

| Aspect | TTA.dev | Karl Stoney (Production) |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| **Platform** | GitHub Actions | Kubernetes Jobs |
| **Model** | Not explicitly set | `gemini-2.5-pro` |
| **Execution** | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
| **Timeout** | 15 minutes | Reasonable limits |
| **Debug Logging** | Now enabled | Enabled |
| **MCP Server** | Docker (pull on every run) | Pre-configured in cluster |
| **Performance** | To be measured | 3-5 minutes |

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Docker Image Pull is the Bottleneck

**Indicators**:
- Pre-pull step takes 5-10+ minutes
- Gemini CLI execution is fast (1-2 minutes)
- Total time = pre-pull time + CLI time

**Solution**:
- Cache Docker image between runs
- Use GitHub Actions cache action
- Or: Pre-pull image in setup step

### Scenario 2: Telemetry is the Bottleneck

**Indicators**:
- Pre-pull is fast (< 1 minute)
- Gemini CLI execution is now fast (1-2 minutes)
- Previous runs were slow due to telemetry overhead

**Solution**:
- Keep telemetry disabled in CI/CD
- Document this requirement

### Scenario 3: Network/API Latency

**Indicators**:
- Both pre-pull and CLI execution are slow
- Debug logs show long API response times
- Retry attempts visible in logs

**Solution**:
- Consider regional API endpoints
- Implement retry with exponential backoff
- Add timeout thresholds

### Scenario 4: Multiple Factors

**Indicators**:
- Pre-pull takes significant time
- CLI execution also slow
- Debug logs show various bottlenecks

**Solution**:
- Apply multiple optimizations
- Prioritize based on impact

## Lessons Learned

### From Previous Investigation

1. **Always check the source code** - The `--yolo` flag was present all along
2. **Production benchmarks are invaluable** - Karl's blog provided critical baseline
3. **Settings can be redundant** - CLI flags override settings files
4. **Timeouts are essential** - Prevent runaway executions
5. **Debug logging is critical** - Can't troubleshoot without visibility
