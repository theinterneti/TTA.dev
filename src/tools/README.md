# Tools

This directory contains tool integration components for the TTA.dev framework. These are reusable components for integrating external tools and APIs.

## Overview

The tools directory includes:

- Tool abstractions and interfaces
- Integration with various external APIs and services
- Tool execution and management utilities
- Tool discovery and registration mechanisms
- Error handling and retry logic

## Usage

Tools can be imported and used in your applications:

```python
from tta.dev.tools import ToolRegistry

registry = ToolRegistry()
registry.register_tool("calculator", CalculatorTool())
result = registry.execute_tool("calculator", {"operation": "add", "a": 1, "b": 2})
```

## Development

When adding new tool components, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a dedicated directory for each tool type or category
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add unit tests in the corresponding test directory
4. Ensure compatibility with the core TTA framework
