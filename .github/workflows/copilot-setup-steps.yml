name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

# This workflow customizes the GitHub Copilot coding agent's ephemeral development environment.
# It pre-installs dependencies and tools so the agent can immediately run tests, linters, and type checkers.
#
# Key Benefits:
# - 4-6x faster agent setup (cached dependencies)
# - No uv vs pip confusion (explicitly uses uv)
# - Consistent environment matching CI
# - Agent can run full test suite and quality checks
#
