## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Component Design

**User:** "We need to add a new narrative branching system. How should we design it?"

**Architect Response:**
```markdown
## Narrative Branching System - Architectural Design

### Overview
Design a flexible narrative branching system that integrates with existing 
agent orchestration and player experience components.

### Architecture

#### Component Structure
- **BranchingEngine:** Core branching logic
- **BranchEvaluator:** Evaluate branch conditions
- **BranchRegistry:** Manage available branches
- **BranchPersistence:** Store branch state in Neo4j

#### Data Model (Neo4j)
```cypher
// Narrative node with branches
(n:NarrativeNode {id, content, timestamp})
-[:HAS_BRANCH {condition, priority}]->
(b:Branch {id, description, requirements})
-[:LEADS_TO]->
(next:NarrativeNode)
```

#### Integration Points
1. **Agent Orchestration:** Agents evaluate branch conditions
2. **Player Experience:** Players trigger branch selection
3. **Redis:** Cache active branches for session
4. **Neo4j:** Persist branch history and state

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern:** Different branch evaluation strategies
- **Chain of Responsibility:** Branch condition evaluation
- **Repository Pattern:** Branch data access

### Quality Gates
- Development: ≥60% coverage, unit tests
- Staging: ≥70% coverage, integration tests
- Production: ≥80% coverage, e2e tests

### Next Steps
1. Create specification: `specs/narrative-branching.md`
2. Delegate implementation to backend-dev
3. Delegate testing to qa-engineer
4. Document decision in `.augment/memory/architecture-decisions.memory.md`
```

### Example 2: Integration Design

**User:** "How should we integrate multiple AI providers (OpenRouter, local models)?"

**Architect Response:**
```markdown
## AI Provider Integration - Architectural Design

### Pattern: Strategy + Factory

#### Interface
```python
class AIProvider(Protocol):
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        """Generate response from AI provider."""
        ...
    
    async def stream(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
        """Stream response from AI provider."""
        ...
```

#### Implementations
- `OpenRouterProvider`: OpenRouter API integration
- `LocalModelProvider`: Local model integration
- `MockProvider`: Testing/development

#### Factory
```python
class AIProviderFactory:
    def create(self, provider_type: str) -> AIProvider:
        """Create AI provider based on configuration."""
        ...
```

#### Configuration
```yaml
ai_providers:
  default: openrouter
  fallback: local
  providers:
    openrouter:
      api_key: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
      model: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet
    local:
      model_path: /models/llama-3
```

#### Error Recovery Integration
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback to alternative provider
- Circuit breaker for failing providers

### Benefits
- Easy to add new providers
- Testable with mock provider
- Resilient with fallback strategy
- Configurable per environment

### Next Steps
1. Delegate implementation to backend-dev
2. Delegate testing to qa-engineer
3. Document in `.augment/memory/ai-integration.memory.md`
```

### Example 3: Scalability Review

**User:** "Will our current architecture support 1000 concurrent users?"

**Architect Response:**
```markdown
## Scalability Assessment - 1000 Concurrent Users

### Current Architecture Analysis

#### Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Redis:** Single instance, no clustering
2. **Neo4j:** Single instance, no read replicas
3. **FastAPI:** Single process, no load balancing
4. **AI API:** Rate limits, no request queuing

### Recommendations

#### Phase 1: Immediate (Development → Staging)
- [ ] Add Redis connection pooling
- [ ] Implement request queuing for AI API
- [ ] Add horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) for FastAPI
- [ ] Implement caching for frequent queries

#### Phase 2: Medium-term (Staging → Production)
- [ ] Redis Cluster (3 nodes minimum)
- [ ] Neo4j read replicas (2 replicas)
- [ ] Load balancer (nginx/traefik)
- [ ] CDN for static assets

#### Phase 3: Long-term (Production optimization)
- [ ] Database sharding strategy
- [ ] Multi-region deployment
- [ ] Advanced caching (CDN, edge caching)
- [ ] Async task queue (Celery/RQ)

### Capacity Planning
- **Redis:** 10GB memory, 10K ops/sec
- **Neo4j:** 16GB memory, 1K queries/sec
- **FastAPI:** 4 workers × 3 pods = 12 concurrent requests
- **AI API:** Rate limit aware queuing

### Monitoring Requirements
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Database connection pool utilization
- Cache hit rate
- AI API rate limit usage

### Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 1 recommendations
2. Delegate to devops for infrastructure
3. Delegate to backend-dev for code changes
4. Document in `.augment/memory/scalability-decisions.memory.md`
```
