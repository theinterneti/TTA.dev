# Logseq Knowledge Base Integration - Complete

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Deployment
**Integration Type:** Project Knowledge Management

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete **Logseq-based knowledge management system** integrated with TTA.dev, providing a "project brain" for managing complexity, research, and daily workflows.

### Key Features

- **Private by design** - Separate git repository for notes (not in main repo)
- **Symlink integration** - Easy access from main project without pollution
- **Auto-sync ready** - GitHub Personal Access Token + logseq-git plugin
- **Pre-configured dashboard** - Live queries for tasks, projects, and research

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (For User)

### 1. Create Private Repository

```bash
# On GitHub.com
# Create new PRIVATE repo: "TTA-notes"
# (Do NOT initialize with README)
```

### 2. Move and Symlink

```bash
# Clone the private repo
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA-notes.git

# Move logseq folder contents
mv ~/repos/TTA.dev/logseq/* ~/TTA-notes/
mv ~/repos/TTA.dev/logseq/.gitignore ~/TTA-notes/
rmdir ~/repos/TTA.dev/logseq

# Create symlink
ln -s ~/TTA-notes ~/repos/TTA.dev/logseq

# Commit to private repo
cd ~/TTA-notes
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Logseq knowledge base for TTA.dev"
git push
```

### 3. Open in Logseq

1. Download Logseq: <https://logseq.com>
2. Open the app
3. "Add a new graph" → Select `~/TTA-notes`
4. Dashboard opens automatically

### 4. Configure Auto-Sync

1. Generate GitHub PAT with `repo` scope
2. Install `logseq-git` plugin in Logseq
3. Configure plugin with token
4. Restart Logseq

**Full instructions:** See `logseq/SETUP.md`

## 🎨 Usage Patterns

### Task Management

```markdown
- TODO Fix [[RouterPrimitive]] memory leak
  related:: [[TTA Primitives]]
  code:: [router.py](../packages/tta-dev-primitives/src/tta_dev_primitives/core/router.py)

- DOING Review [[Phase 2 Integration Tests]]
  status:: 60% complete
  blocked:: Waiting for CI fix

- DONE Set up [[Logseq Knowledge Base]]
  completed:: [[2025_10_30]]
```

### Linking to Code

```markdown
## Bug: Memory Leak in Sequential Primitive

### Location
[base.py](../packages/tta-dev-primitives/src/tta_dev_primitives/core/base.py)

### Related Files
- [sequential.py](../packages/tta-dev-primitives/src/tta_dev_primitives/core/sequential.py)
- [test_sequential.py](../packages/tta-dev-primitives/tests/core/test_sequential.py)
```

### Research Tracking

```markdown
# LLM Router Strategy

## Research
- [[2025_10_25]] - Initial experiments
- [[2025_10_27]] - Cost analysis
- [[AI Research/LangChain Patterns]]

## Implementation
- [[TTA Primitives/RouterPrimitive]]
- [[Architecture Decisions/ADR-005]]

## Results
- 30-40% cost reduction
- 80%+ quality maintained
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With TTA.dev Repository

| Public Docs (in repo) | Private Notes (in Logseq) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| `docs/` - User guides | Daily journals |
| `AGENTS.md` - AI instructions | Research notes |
| `README.md` - Public overview | Decision logs |
| Package READMEs | Task tracking |
| Examples | Brainstorming |

**Philosophy:** Public docs are polished and user-facing. Logseq is for the messy, in-progress work.

### With Development Workflow

1. **Morning:** Review Logseq dashboard for priorities
2. **During work:** Log tasks, bugs, and ideas in journal
3. **Code changes:** Link to journal entries from commit messages
4. **Evening:** Mark tasks DONE, reflect, plan tomorrow

### With Git Workflow

```bash
# Example commit message
git commit -m "feat(primitives): Add RouterPrimitive

Implements dynamic LLM routing based on input complexity.

Decision rationale: See logseq journal [[2025_10_27]]
Architecture: See [[Architecture Decisions/ADR-005]]
"
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Solo Development

- **Brain dump:** Capture ideas without context switching
- **Task tracking:** Visual TODO list with automatic queries
- **Research log:** Link experiments to implementations
- **Decision history:** Never forget why you did something

### For Multi-Agent Coordination

- **Shared context:** Multiple agents can reference same knowledge base
- **Decision transparency:** Agent reasoning logged in pages
- **Coordination:** Task dependencies and blockers visible
- **Knowledge transfer:** New agents can read project history

### For Long-Term Maintenance

- **Onboarding:** New developers read journals to understand project evolution
- **Debugging:** Historical context for why code exists
- **Refactoring:** Know what was tried before and why it failed
- **Documentation:** Generate docs from Logseq content

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### What's Private

- Daily journals (your work log)
- Research notes and experiments
- Decision rationale and debates
- Task lists and priorities
- Personal reflections

### What's Public

- Code in main TTA.dev repo
- Documentation in `docs/`
- Examples and guides
- Package READMEs

### Best Practices

- ✅ Use private TTA-notes repo
- ✅ Rotate GitHub PAT every 90 days
- ✅ Never commit logseq/ to main repo
- ❌ Don't put secrets/credentials in notes
- ❌ Don't put company IP in public examples
